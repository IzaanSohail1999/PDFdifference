Your Cost Share is the amount you are required to pay

be a Copayment or Coinsurance. 
If your coverage includes a Plan Deductible and you 
receive Services that are subject to the Plan Deductible, 
your Cost Share for those Services will be Charges until 
you reach the Plan Deductible. Similarly, if your 
coverage includes a Drug Deductible, and you receive 
Services that are subject to the Drug Deductible, your 
Cost Share for those Services will be Charges until you 
reach the Drug Deductible. 
Please refer to the "Cost Share Summary" section of this 
EOC for the amount you will pay for Services.

the Cost Share when the item is ordered. For 
outpatient prescription drugs, the order date is the 
date that the pharmacy processes the order after 
receiving all of the information they need to fill the 
prescription
