Cost Share Summary Tables by Benefit 
How to read the Cost Share summary tables 
Each table below explains the Cost Share for a category of benefits. Specific Services related to the benefit are described in 
the first column of each table. For a detailed description of coverage for a particular benefit, please refer to the same benefit 
heading in the "Benefits" section of this EOC. 
•  Copayment / Coinsurance. This column describes the Cost Share you will pay for Services after you have met your 
Plan Deductible or Drug Deductible, if applicable. (Please see the "Deductible(s) and Out-of-Pocket Maximum(s)" 
section above to determine if your plan includes deductibles.) If the Services are not covered in your plan, this 
column will read "Not covered." If we provide an Allowance that you can use toward the cost of the Services, this 
column will include the Allowance. 
•  Subject to Deductible. This column explains whether the Cost Share you pay for Services is subject to a Plan 
Deductible or Drug Deductible. If the Services are subject to a deductible, you will pay Charges for those Services 
until you have met your deductible. If the Services are subject to a deductible, there will be a "✔" or "●" in this 
column, depending on which deductible applies ("✔" for Plan Deductible, "●" for Drug Deductible). If the Services 
do not apply to a deductible, or if your plan does not include a deductible, this column will be blank. For a more 
detailed explanation of deductibles, please refer to "Plan Deductible" and "Drug Deductible" in the "Benefits" 
section of this EOC. 
•  OOPM. This column explains whether the Cost Share you pay for Services counts toward the Plan Out-of-Pocket 
Maximum ("OOPM") after you have met any applicable deductible. If the Services count toward the Plan OOPM, 
there will be a "✔" in this column. If the Services do not count toward the Plan OOPM, this column will be blank. 
For a more detailed explanation of the Plan OOPM, please refer to "Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum" heading in the 
"Benefits" section of this EOC.

Physician prescribes more than this, you may be able to obtain more than a 30-day supply at one time up to the day supply 
limit for that drug. Applicable Cost Share will apply. For example, two 30-day copayments may be due when picking up a 
60-day prescription, three copayments may be due when picking up a 100-day prescription at the pharmacy.

Introduction 
This Combined Membership Agreement, Evidence of 
Coverage, and Disclosure Form ("EOC") describes the 
health care coverage of "Kaiser Permanente - Platinum 
90 HMO." This EOC, your Premiums included in your 
renewal materials, and which are incorporated into this 
EOC by reference, and any amendments, constitute the 
legally binding contract between Kaiser Foundation 
Health Plan, Inc. ("Health Plan") and the Subscriber. 
For benefits provided under any other program, refer to 
that other plan's evidence of coverage. 
Once enrolled in other coverage made available through 
Health Plan, that other plan's evidence of coverage 
cannot be cancelled without cancelling coverage under 
this EOC, unless the change is made during open 
enrollment or a special enrollment period. 
In this EOC, Health Plan is sometimes referred to as 
"we" or "us." Members are sometimes referred to as 
"you." Some capitalized terms have special meaning in 
this EOC; please see the "Definitions" section for terms 
you should know. 
It is important to familiarize yourself with your coverage 
by reading this EOC completely, so that you can take full 
advantage of your Health Plan benefits. Also, if you have 
special health care needs, please carefully read the 
sections that apply to you. 
About Kaiser Permanente 
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING 
INFORMATION SO THAT YOU WILL KNOW 
FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF 
PROVIDERS YOU MAY GET HEALTH CARE. 
When you join Kaiser Permanente, you are enrolling in 
one of two Health Plan Regions in California (either our 
Northern California Region or Southern California 
Region), which we call your "Home Region." The 
Service Area of each Region is described in the 
"Definitions" section of this EOC. The coverage 
information in this EOC applies when you obtain care in 
your Home Region. When you visit the other California 
Region, you may receive care as described in "Receiving 
Care Outside of Your Home Region" in the "How to 
Obtain Services" section. 
Kaiser Permanente provides Services directly to our 
Members through an integrated medical care program. 
Health Plan, Plan Hospitals, and the Medical Group 
work together to provide our Members with quality care. 
Our medical care program gives you access to all of the 
covered Services you may need, such as routine care 
with your own personal Plan Physician, hospital care, 
laboratory and pharmacy Services, Emergency Services, 
Urgent Care, and other benefits described in this EOC. 
Plus, our health education programs offer you great ways 
to protect and improve your health. 
We provide covered Services to Members using Plan 
Providers located in your Home Region Service Area, 
which is described in the "Definitions" section. You must 
receive all covered care from Plan Providers inside your 
Home Region Service Area, except as described in the 
sections listed below for the following Services: 
•  Authorized referrals as described under "Getting a 
Referral" in the "How to Obtain Services" section 
•  Emergency ambulance Services as described under 
"Ambulance Services" in the "Benefits" section 
•  Emergency Services, Post-Stabilization Care, and 
Out-of-Area Urgent Care as described in the 
"Emergency Services and Urgent Care" section 
•  Hospice care as described under "Hospice Care" in 
the "Benefits" section 
•  Visiting Member Services as described under 
"Receiving Care Outside of Your Home Region" in 
the "How to Obtain Services" section 
Term of this EOC, Renewal, and 
Amendment 
Term of this EOC 
This EOC becomes effective on the membership 
effective date in the Subscriber's acceptance letter and 
will remain in effect until one of the following occurs: 
•  The EOC is amended as described under 
"Amendment of EOC" in this "Introduction" section 
•  There are no longer any Members in your Family who 
are covered under this EOC 
Note: Your membership may terminate or be rescinded 
even if this EOC remains in effect for other covered 
Members of your Family. The "Termination of 
Membership" section explains how membership may 
terminate or be rescinded. 
Renewal 
If you comply with all of the terms of this EOC, we will 
automatically renew this EOC each year, effective 
January 1. Terms of the EOC will remain the same when 
we renew it unless we have amended the EOC as

will not apply toward any deductible or out-of-pocket 
maximum). 
Amendment of EOC 
In accord with "Notices Regarding Your Coverage" in 
the "Miscellaneous Provisions" section, we may amend 
this EOC (including Premiums and benefits) at any 
time by sending written notice to the Subscriber at 
least 15 days prior to the start of the annual open 
enrollment period or 60 days before the effective date 
of the amendment. 
An amendment may become effective earlier than the 
end of the period for which you have already paid your 
Premiums, and it may require you to pay additional 
Premiums for that period. All amendments are deemed 
accepted by the Subscriber unless the Subscriber gives us 
written notice of non-acceptance within 30 days of the 
date of the notice, in which case this EOC terminates the 
day before the effective date of the amendment. 
If we notified the Subscriber that we have not received 
all necessary governmental approvals related to this 
EOC, we may amend this EOC by giving written notice 
to the Subscriber after receiving all necessary 
governmental approval, in accord with "Notices 
Regarding Your Coverage" in the "Miscellaneous 
Provisions" section. Any such government-approved 
provisions go into effect on January 1, 2021 (unless the 
government requires a later effective date). 
Definitions 
Some terms have special meaning in this EOC. When we 
use a term with special meaning in only one section of 
this EOC, we define it in that section. The terms in this 
"Definitions" section have special meaning when 
capitalized and used in any section of this EOC. 
Accumulation Period: A period of time no greater than 
12 consecutive months for purposes of accumulating 
amounts toward any deductibles (if applicable), out-of-
pocket maximums, and benefit limits. For example, the 
Accumulation Period may be a calendar year or contract 
year. The Accumulation Period for this EOC is from 
January 1 through December 31. 
Adult Member: A Member who is age 19 or older and 
is not a Pediatric Member. For example, if you turn 19 
on June 25, you will be an Adult Member starting July 1. 
Allowance: A specified amount that you can use toward 
the purchase price of an item. If the price of the item(s) 
you select exceeds the Allowance, you will pay the 
amount in excess of the Allowance (and that payment 
Ancillary Coverage: Optional benefits such as 
acupuncture, chiropractic, or dental coverage that may be 
available to Members enrolled under this EOC. If your 
plan includes Ancillary Coverage, this coverage will be 
described in an amendment to this EOC or a separate 
agreement from the issuer of the coverage. Note: 
Pediatric dental coverage is not considered to be optional 
Ancillary Coverage. 
Charges: "Charges" means the following: 
•  For Services provided by the Medical Group or 
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, the charges in Health 
Plan's schedule of Medical Group and Kaiser 
Foundation Hospitals charges for Services provided 
to Members 
•  For Services for which a provider (other than the 
Medical Group or Kaiser Foundation Hospitals) is 
compensated on a capitation basis, the charges in the 
schedule of charges that Kaiser Permanente 
negotiates with the capitated provider 
•  For items obtained at a pharmacy owned and operated 
by Kaiser Permanente, the amount the pharmacy 
would charge a Member for the item if a Member's 
benefit plan did not cover the item (this amount is an 
estimate of: the cost of acquiring, storing, and 
dispensing drugs, the direct and indirect costs of 
providing Kaiser Permanente pharmacy Services to 
Members, and the pharmacy program's contribution 
to the net revenue requirements of Health Plan) 
•  For all other Services, the payments that Kaiser 
Permanente makes for the Services or, if Kaiser 
Permanente subtracts your Cost Share from its 
payment, the amount Kaiser Permanente would have 
paid if it did not subtract your Cost Share 
Coinsurance: A percentage of Charges that you must 
pay when you receive a covered Service under this EOC. 
Copayment: A specific dollar amount that you must pay 
when you receive a covered Service under this EOC. 
Note: The dollar amount of the Copayment can be $0 
(no charge). 
Cost Share: The amount you are required to pay for 
covered Services. For example, your Cost Share may be 
a Copayment or Coinsurance. If your coverage includes a 
Plan Deductible and you receive Services that are subject 
to the Plan Deductible, your Cost Share for those 
Services will be Charges until you reach the Plan 
Deductible. Similarly, if your coverage includes a Drug 
Deductible, and you receive Services that are subject to 
the Drug Deductible, your Cost Share for those Services 
will be Charges until you reach the Drug Deductible.

If you have a question about whether a ZIP code is in 
your Home Region Service Area, please call our Member 
Service Contact Center. 
Note: We may expand your Home Region Service Area 
at any time by giving written notice to the Subscriber. 
ZIP codes are subject to change by the U.S. Postal 
Service. 
Services: Health care services or items ("health care" 
includes both physical health care and mental health 
care), behavioral health treatment covered under 
"Behavioral Health Treatment for Pervasive 
Developmental Disorder or Autism" in the "Benefits" 
section, and services to treat Serious Emotional 
Disturbance of a Child Under Age 18 or Severe Mental 
Illness. 
Severe Mental Illness: The following mental disorders: 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder 
(manic-depressive illness), major depressive disorders,

provision of 24-hour-a-day licensed skilled nursing care. 
The term "Skilled Nursing Facility" does not include 
convalescent nursing homes, rest facilities, or facilities 
for the aged, if those facilities furnish primarily custodial 
care, including training in routines of daily living. A 
"Skilled Nursing Facility" may also be a unit or section 
within another facility (for example, a hospital) as long 
as it continues to meet this definition. 
Spouse: The person to whom the Subscriber is legally 
married under applicable law. For the purposes of this 
EOC, the term "Spouse" includes the Subscriber's 
domestic partner. "Domestic partners" are two people 
who are registered and legally recognized as domestic 
partners by California. 
Stabilize: To provide the medical treatment of the 
Emergency Medical Condition that is necessary to 
assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no 
material deterioration of the condition is likely to result 
from or occur during the transfer of the person from the 
facility. With respect to a pregnant woman who is having 
contractions, when there is inadequate time to safely 
transfer her to another hospital before delivery (or the 
transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the 
woman or unborn child), "Stabilize" means to deliver 
(including the placenta). 
Subscriber: A Member who is eligible for membership 
on their own behalf and not by virtue of Dependent 
status and for whom we have received applicable 
Premiums. 
Telehealth Visits: Interactive video visits and scheduled 
telephone visits between you and your provider. 
Urgent Care: Medically Necessary Services for a 
condition that requires prompt medical attention but is 
not an Emergency Medical Condition. 
Premiums, Eligibility, and 
Enrollment 
Premiums 
Only Members for whom we have received Full 
Premiums are entitled to coverage under this EOC, and 
then only for the period for which we have received the 
required Premium payment. You must prepay the 
Premiums included in your renewal materials for each 
month on or before the last day of the preceding month. 
Returned checks or insufficient funds on electronic 
payments will be subject to a $25 fee. If we do not 
receive your Premium payment by the due date, we may 
terminate your membership as described under 
"Termination for Nonpayment of Premiums" in the 
"Termination of Membership" section. 
Effective date of Premiums for new Members 
Premiums are effective on the same day that the new 
Member's coverage is effective. For effective dates for 
open enrollment, see "Open enrollment period" under 
"How to Enroll and When Coverage Begins" in this 
"Premiums, Eligibility, and Enrollment" section. For 
information about effective dates for special enrollment, 
visit kp.org/specialenrollment or call our Member 
Service Contact Center. 
When your Premiums may change 
We may amend the Premiums included in your renewal 
materials by sending written notice at least 60 days 
before the effective date of the amendment, as described 
under "Amendment of EOC" under "Term of this EOC, 
Renewal, and Amendment" in the "Introduction" section. 
Also, your Premiums may change as follows: 
•  When you add a new Dependent, Premiums are 
effective as described under "Effective date of 
Premiums for new Members" in this "Premiums" 
section 
•  When you drop Dependents or move to a new rate 
area, any change in Premiums will take effect at the 
same time the change becomes effective 
•  When you progress to a new age band, any change in 
Premiums will take effect upon renewal. Note: If your 
application for health coverage provided an incorrect 
birth date, Premiums will be adjusted to reflect the 
correct age as of the effective date of coverage for the 
current plan year 
For more information about how Premiums may change, 
please see the Rate Chart Guide on our website at 
kp.org/renewalinfo or call our Member Service Contact 
Center. 
If a government agency or other taxing authority imposes 
or increases a tax or other charge (other than a tax on or 
measured by net income) upon Health Plan or Plan 
Providers (or any of their activities), we may increase 
Premiums to include your share of the new or increased 
tax or charge by sending written notice to the Subscriber 
at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change. 
Your share is determined by dividing the number of 
enrolled Members in your Family by the total number of 
Members enrolled in your Home Region Service Area. 
Premiums for Ancillary Coverage 
If you have selected Ancillary Coverage provided under 
any other program, the Premium for that Ancillary 
Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families

Coverage will be billed together with required Premiums 
for coverage under this EOC. Full Premiums will then 
also include Premium for Ancillary Coverage. This 
means if you do not pay the Full Premiums owed by the 
due date, we may terminate your membership under this 
EOC and any Ancillary Coverage, as described in the 
"Termination for Nonpayment of Premiums" section. 
Who Is Eligible 
To enroll and to continue enrollment, you must meet all 
of the eligibility requirements described in this "Who Is 
Eligible" section. 
Service Area eligibility requirements if you are 
enrolled through Covered California 
When you join Kaiser Permanente, you are enrolling in 
one of two Health Plan Regions in California (either our 
Northern California Region or Southern California 
Region), which we call your "Home Region." The 
Service Area of each Region is described in the 
"Definitions" section of this EOC. The Subscriber must 
live in the Service Area of one of our California Regions. 
The coverage information in this EOC applies when you 
obtain care in your Home Region. When you visit the 
other California Region, you may receive care as 
described in "Receiving Care Outside of Your Home 
Region" in the "How to Obtain Services" section of this 
EOC. 
Service Area eligibility requirements if you are 
enrolled directly with Kaiser Permanente 
When you join Kaiser Permanente, you are enrolling in 
one of two Health Plan Regions in California (either our 
Northern California Region or Southern California 
Region), which we call your "Home Region." The 
Service Area of each Region is described in the 
"Definitions" section of this EOC. The Subscriber must 
live in the Service Area of one of our California Regions 
at the time they enroll. The coverage information in this 
EOC applies when you obtain care in your Home 
Region. When you visit the other California Region, you 
may receive care as described in "Receiving Care 
Outside of Your Home Region" in the "How to Obtain 
Services" section of this EOC. 
If the Subscriber moves from your Home Region to the 
other California Region, we will transfer the membership 
of the Subscriber and all Dependents to the Individuals 
and Families Plan in that Region that is most similar to 
this plan. All terms and conditions in your application for 
health coverage, including the Conditions of Acceptance 
and Arbitration Agreement, will continue to apply. We 
will provide the Subscriber with the effective date of 
coverage and a Kaiser Permanente ID card for each 
Member of the Family with a new medical record 
number on it. For more information about premiums that 
apply in the other California Region, please refer to the 
Rate Chart Guide on our website at kp.org/renewalinfo 
or call our Member Service Contact Center. 
If the Subscriber moves to the service area of a Region 
outside California, you may be able to apply for 
membership in that Region by contacting the member or 
customer service department there, but the plan, 
including coverage, premiums, and eligibility 
requirements, might not be the same as under this EOC. 
If the Subscriber moves anywhere else outside your 
Home Region Service Area after enrollment, you can 
continue your membership as long as you meet all other 
eligibility requirements. However, you must receive 
covered Services from Plan Providers inside your Home 
Region Service Area, except as described in the sections 
listed below for the following Services: 
•  Authorized referrals as described under "Getting a 
Referral" in the "How to Obtain Services" section 
•  Emergency ambulance Services as described under 
"Ambulance Services" in the "Benefits" section 
•  Emergency Services, Post-Stabilization Care, and 
Out-of-Area Urgent Care as described in the 
"Emergency Services and Urgent Care" section 
•  Hospice care as described under "Hospice Care" in 
the "Benefits" section 
•  Visiting Member Services as described under 
"Receiving Care Outside of Your Home Region" in 
the "How to Obtain Services" section 
Eligibility as a Dependent 
Enrolling a Dependent 
If you are a Subscriber, the following persons are eligible 
to enroll as your Dependents: 
•  Your Spouse 
•  Your or your Spouse's Dependent children, who meet 
the requirements described under "Age limit of 
Dependent children," if they are any of the following: 
  sons, daughters, or stepchildren 
  adopted children 
  children placed with you for adoption 
  children for whom you or your Spouse is the 
court-appointed guardian (or was when the child 
reached age 18) 
•  Children whose parent is a Dependent under your 
family coverage (including adopted children and 
Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families 
2021 Kaiser Permanente – Platinum 90 HMO                                                                                                 
Date: July 28, 2020 
Page 25 
children placed with your Dependent for adoption) if 
they meet all of the following requirements: 
  they are not married and do not have a domestic 
partner (for the purposes of this requirement only, 
"domestic partner" means someone who is 
registered and legally recognized as a domestic 
partner by California) 
  they meet the requirements described under "Age 
limit of Dependent children" 
  they receive all of their support and maintenance 
from you or your Spouse 
  they permanently reside with you or your Spouse 
If you have a baby 
If you have a baby while enrolled under this EOC, the 
baby is not automatically enrolled in this plan. The 
Subscriber must request enrollment of the baby as 
described under "Special enrollment" in the "How to 
Enroll and When Coverage Begins" section below. If the 
Subscriber does not request enrollment within this 
special enrollment period, the baby will only be covered 
under this plan for 31 days (including the date of birth), 
or until the date the baby is enrolled in other coverage, 
whichever happens first. 
Age limit of Dependent children 
Children must be under age 26 as of the effective date to 
enroll as a Dependent under your plan. 
Dependent children are eligible to remain on the plan 
through the end of the calendar year, as long as they are 
under the age limit on the effective date of this EOC. 
Dependent children of the Subscriber or Spouse 
(including adopted children and children placed with you 
for adoption) who reach the age limit may continue 
coverage under this EOC if all of the following 
conditions are met: 
•  They meet all requirements to be a Dependent except 
for the age limit 
•  They are incapable of self-sustaining employment 
because of a physically- or mentally-disabling injury, 
illness, or condition that occurred before they reached 
the age limit for Dependents 
•  They receive 50 percent or more of their support and 
maintenance from you or your Spouse 
•  You give us proof of their incapacity and dependency 
within 60 days after we request it (see "Disabled 
Dependent certification" below in this "Eligibility as a 
Dependent" section) 
Disabled Dependent certification 
One of the requirements for a Dependent to be eligible to 
continue coverage as a disabled Dependent is that the 
Subscriber must provide us documentation of the 
dependent's incapacity and dependency as follows: 
•  If the child is a Member, we will send the Subscriber 
a notice of the Dependent's membership termination 
due to loss of eligibility at least 90 days before the 
date coverage will end due to reaching the age limit. 
The Dependent's membership will terminate as 
described in our notice unless the Subscriber provides 
us documentation of the Dependent's incapacity and 
dependency within 60 days of receipt of our notice 
and we determine that the Dependent is eligible as a 
disabled dependent. If the Subscriber provides us this 
documentation in the specified time period and we do 
not make a determination about eligibility before the 
termination date, coverage will continue until we 
make a determination. If we determine that the 
Dependent does not meet the eligibility requirements 
as a disabled dependent, we will notify the Subscriber 
that the Dependent is not eligible and let the 
Subscriber know the membership termination date. If 
we determine that the Dependent is eligible as a 
disabled dependent, there will be no lapse in 
coverage. Also, starting two years after the date that 
the Dependent reached the age limit, the Subscriber 
must provide us documentation of the Dependent's 
incapacity and dependency annually within 60 days 
after we request it so that we can determine if the 
Dependent continues to be eligible as a disabled 
dependent 
•  If the child is not a Member because you are changing 
coverage, you must give us proof, within 60 days 
after we request it, of the child's incapacity and 
dependency as well as proof of the child's coverage 
under your prior coverage. In the future, you must 
provide proof of the child's continued incapacity and 
dependency within 60 days after you receive our 
request, but not more frequently than annually 
Persons barred from enrolling 
You cannot enroll if you have had your entitlement to 
receive Services through Health Plan terminated for 
cause. 
Members with Medicare 
This plan is not intended for most Medicare 
beneficiaries. If you are (or become) eligible for 
Medicare during the term of this EOC, you may be able 
to enroll in Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage. The 
premiums and coverage under our Senior Advantage 
plan are different from those under this EOC. 
Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families 
2021 Kaiser Permanente – Platinum 90 HMO

Medicare late enrollment penalties 
If you become eligible for Medicare Part B and do not 
enroll, Medicare may require you to pay a late 
enrollment penalty if you later enroll in Medicare Part B. 
However, if you delay enrollment in Part B because you 
or your spouse are still working and have coverage 
through an employer group health plan, you may not 
have to pay the penalty. Also, if you are (or become) 
eligible for Medicare and go without creditable 
prescription drug coverage (drug coverage that is at least 
as good as the standard Medicare Part D prescription 
drug coverage) for a continuous period of 63 days or 
more, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty if 
you later sign up for Medicare prescription drug 
coverage. If you are (or become) eligible for Medicare, 
we will send you a notice that tells you whether your 
drug coverage under this EOC is creditable prescription 
drug coverage at the times required by the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services and upon your request. 
For more information, contact our Member Service 
Contact Center. 
How to Enroll and When Coverage 
Begins 
How to enroll through Covered California 
To request enrollment, you must submit a completed 
application to Covered California along with any other 
information that they require. For information about how 
to apply for a plan through Covered California, visit the 
Covered California website at CoveredCA.com or call 
the Covered California Service Center at the number 
listed under "How to Reach Covered California" in the 
"Helpful Information" section. 
How to enroll directly through Kaiser 
Permanente 
When you first request enrollment, you must submit a 
completed application for health coverage for the 
Subscriber and any Dependents. If you are eligible for 
Medicare Part A or have Medicare Part B, you cannot 
enroll because this plan would duplicate your Medicare 
benefits. The annual open enrollment period is described 
under "Open enrollment period" in this "How to Enroll 
and When Coverage Begins" section. For information 
about special enrollment periods, refer to "Special 
enrollment" in this "How to Enroll and When Coverage 
Begins" section. If you are requesting enrollment in 
accord with the "Special enrollment" section, you will be 
required to provide proof that you have experienced a 
qualifying life event. 
If you are already enrolled as a Subscriber and want to 
request enrollment of a Dependent during the annual 
open enrollment period or a special enrollment period, 
you must submit a completed account change form. The 
annual open enrollment period is described under "Open 
enrollment period" in this "How to Enroll and When 
Coverage Begins" section. For information about special 
enrollment periods, refer to "Special enrollment" in this 
"How to Enroll and When Coverage Begins" section. If 
you are requesting enrollment of a Dependent in accord 
with the "Special enrollment" section, you will be 
required to provide proof that you have experienced a 
qualifying life event. 
Note: During the enrollment process if we discover that 
you or someone on your behalf intentionally provided 
incomplete or incorrect material information on your 
enrollment application, we will rescind your 
membership. This means that we will completely cancel 
your membership so that no coverage ever existed. If 
your membership is rescinded, you must pay full 
Charges for any Services you received. Please refer to 
"Rescission of Membership" in the "Termination of 
Membership" section for details. 
Selecting and switching your benefit plan 
When you first enroll, you must select a plan to enroll in. 
You cannot switch plans until the next open enrollment 
period unless you qualify for special enrollment (for 
more information, see "Special Enrollment" in this "How 
to Enroll and When Coverage Begins" section). Also, 
you cannot switch plans if you are eligible for Medicare 
Part A or have Medicare Part B because enrollment into 
a new plan would duplicate your Medicare benefits. If 
you qualify for special enrollment and are thinking about 
switching to a different plan, please examine your 
coverage options carefully. Cost Share and Premiums 
vary between plans. To learn more about other plans we 
offer, call our Member Service Contact Center. If you 
want a copy of the membership agreement and evidence 
of coverage for another plan we offer, ask the 
representative to send you one. 
Open enrollment period 
You may apply for enrollment by submitting an 
application or account change form as described in the 
"How to Enroll and When Coverage Begins" section 
during the open enrollment period. The open enrollment 
period is established by California law each year. Visit 
kp.org/compareplans or CoveredCA.com for more 
information on the open enrollment period, including 
applicable dates. If your application is accepted during 
the open enrollment period, we will notify you of your 
membership effective date. If you have questions, please 
call our Member Service Contact Center.

As a Member, you are enrolled in one of two Health Plan 
Regions in California (either our Northern California 
Region or Southern California Region), called your 
Home Region. The coverage information in this EOC 
applies when you obtain care in your Home Region. 
Our medical care program gives you access to all of the 
covered Services you may need, such as routine care 
with your own personal Plan Physician, hospital care, 
laboratory and pharmacy Services, Emergency Services, 
Urgent Care, and other benefits described in this EOC. 
Routine Care 
If you need the following Services, you should schedule 
an appointment: 
•  Preventive Services 
•  Periodic follow-up care (regularly scheduled follow-
up care, such as visits to monitor a chronic condition) 
•  Other care that is not Urgent Care 
To request a non-urgent appointment, you can call your 
local Plan Facility or request the appointment online. For 
appointment phone numbers, please refer to our Provider 
Directory or call our Member Service Contact Center. To 
request an appointment online, go to our website at 
kp.org. 
Urgent Care 
An Urgent Care need is one that requires prompt medical 
attention but is not an Emergency Medical Condition. If 
you think you may need Urgent Care, call the 
appropriate appointment or advice phone number at a 
Plan Facility. For phone numbers, please refer to our 
Provider Directory or call our Member Service Contact 
Center. 
For information about Out-of-Area Urgent Care, please 
refer to "Urgent Care" in the "Emergency Services and 
Urgent Care" section. 
Not Sure What Kind of Care You Need? 
Sometimes it's difficult to know what kind of care you 
need, so we have licensed health care professionals 
available to assist you by phone 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week. Here are some of the ways they can help 
you: 
•  They can answer questions about a health concern, 
and instruct you on self-care at home if appropriate 
•  They can advise you about whether you should get 
medical care, and how and where to get care (for 
example, if you are not sure whether your condition is 
an Emergency Medical Condition, they can help you 
decide whether you need Emergency Services or 
Urgent Care, and how and where to get that care)

•  They can tell you what to do if you need care and a 
Plan Medical Office is closed or you are outside your 
Home Region Service Area 
You can reach one of these licensed health care 
professionals by calling the appointment or advice phone 
number (for phone numbers, refer to our Provider 
Directory or call our Member Service Contact Center). 
When you call, a trained support person may ask you 
questions to help determine how to direct your call. 
Your Personal Plan Physician 
Personal Plan Physicians provide primary care and play 
an important role in coordinating care, including hospital 
stays and referrals to specialists. 
We encourage you to choose a personal Plan Physician. 
You may choose any available personal Plan Physician. 
Parents may choose a pediatrician as the personal Plan 
Physician for their child. Most personal Plan Physicians 
are Primary Care Physicians (generalists in internal 
medicine, pediatrics, or family practice, or specialists in 
obstetrics/gynecology whom the Medical Group 
designates as Primary Care Physicians). Some specialists 
who are not designated as Primary Care Physicians but 
who also provide primary care may be available as 
personal Plan Physicians. For example, some specialists 
in internal medicine and obstetrics/gynecology who are 
not designated as Primary Care Physicians may be 
available as personal Plan Physicians. However, if you 
choose a specialist who is not designated as a Primary 
Care Physician as your personal Plan Physician, the Cost 
Share for a Physician Specialist Visit will apply to all 
visits with the specialist except for routine preventive 
visits listed under "Preventive Services" in the "Benefits" 
section. 
To learn how to select or change to a different personal 
Plan Physician, visit our website at kp.org or call our 
Member Service Contact Center. Refer to our Provider 
Directory for a list of physicians that are available as 
Primary Care Physicians. The directory is updated 
periodically. The availability of Primary Care Physicians 
may change. If you have questions, please call our 
Member Service Contact Center. You can change your 
personal Plan Physician at any time for any reason. 
Getting a Referral 
Referrals to Plan Providers 
A Plan Physician must refer you before you can receive 
care from specialists, such as specialists in surgery, 
orthopedics, cardiology, oncology, dermatology, and 
physical, occupational, and speech therapies. Also, a 
Plan Physician must refer you before you can get care 
from Qualified Autism Service Providers covered under 
"Behavioral Health Treatment for Pervasive 
Developmental Disorder or Autism" in the "Benefits" 
section. However, you do not need a referral or prior 
authorization to receive most care from any of the 
following Plan Providers: 
•  Your personal Plan Physician 
•  Generalists in internal medicine, pediatrics, and 
family practice 
•  Specialists in optometry, mental health Services, 
substance use disorder treatment, and 
obstetrics/gynecology 
A Plan Physician must refer you before you can get care 
from a specialist in urology except that you do not need a 
referral to receive Services related to sexual or 
reproductive health, such as a vasectomy. 
Although a referral or prior authorization is not required 
to receive most care from these providers, a referral may 
be required in the following situations: 
•  The provider may have to get prior authorization for 
certain Services in accord with "Medical Group 
authorization procedure for certain referrals" in this 
"Getting a Referral" section 
•  The provider may have to refer you to a specialist 
who has a clinical background related to your illness 
or condition 
Standing referrals 
If a Plan Physician refers you to a specialist, the referral 
will be for a specific treatment plan. Your treatment plan 
may include a standing referral if ongoing care from the 
specialist is prescribed. For example, if you have a life-
threatening, degenerative, or disabling condition, you can 
get a standing referral to a specialist if ongoing care from 
the specialist is required. 
Medical Group authorization procedure for 
certain referrals 
The following are examples of Services that require prior 
authorization by the Medical Group for the Services to 
be covered ("prior authorization" means that the Medical 
Group must approve the Services in advance): 
•  Durable medical equipment 
•  Ostomy and urological supplies 
•  Services not available from Plan Providers 
•  Transplants 
Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families 
2021 Kaiser Permanente – Platinum 90 HMO

Utilization Management ("UM") is a process that 
determines whether a Service recommended by your 
treating provider is Medically Necessary for you. Prior 
authorization is a UM process that determines whether 
the requested services are Medically Necessary before 
care is provided. If it is Medically Necessary, then you 
will receive authorization to obtain that care in a 
clinically appropriate place consistent with the terms of 
your health coverage. Decisions regarding requests for 
authorization will be made only by licensed physicians 
or other appropriately licensed medical professionals. 
For the complete list of Services that require prior 
authorization, and the criteria that are used to make 
authorization decisions, please visit our website at 
kp.org/UM or call our Member Service Contact Center 
to request a printed copy. 
Please refer to "Post-Stabilization Care" under 
"Emergency Services" in the "Emergency Services and 
Urgent Care" section for authorization requirements that 
apply to Post-Stabilization Care from Non–Plan 
Providers. 
Additional information about prior authorization for 
durable medical equipment and ostomy and urological 
supplies 
The prior authorization process for durable medical 
equipment and ostomy and urological supplies includes 
the use of formulary guidelines. These guidelines were 
developed by a multidisciplinary clinical and operational 
work group with review and input from Plan Physicians 
and medical professionals with clinical expertise. The 
formulary guidelines are periodically updated to keep 
pace with changes in medical technology and clinical 
practice. 
If your Plan Physician prescribes one of these items, they 
will submit a written referral in accord with the UM 
process described in this "Medical Group authorization 
procedure for certain referrals" section. If the formulary 
guidelines do not specify that the prescribed item is 
appropriate for your medical condition, the referral will 
be submitted to the Medical Group's designee Plan 
Physician, who will make an authorization decision as 
described under "Medical Group's decision time frames" 
in this "Medical Group authorization procedure for 
certain referrals" section. 
Medical Group's decision time frames 
The applicable Medical Group designee will make the 
authorization decision within the time frame appropriate 
for your condition, but no later than five business days 
after receiving all of the information (including 
additional examination and test results) reasonably 
necessary to make the decision, except that decisions 
about urgent Services will be made no later than 72 
hours after receipt of the information reasonably 
necessary to make the decision. If the Medical Group 
needs more time to make the decision because it doesn't 
have information reasonably necessary to make the 
decision, or because it has requested consultation by a 
particular specialist, you and your treating physician will 
be informed about the additional information, testing, or 
specialist that is needed, and the date that the Medical 
Group expects to make a decision. 
Your treating physician will be informed of the decision 
within 24 hours after the decision is made. If the Services 
are authorized, your physician will be informed of the 
scope of the authorized Services. If the Medical Group 
does not authorize all of the Services, Health Plan will 
send you a written decision and explanation within two 
business days after the decision is made. Any written 
criteria that the Medical Group uses to make the decision 
to authorize, modify, delay, or deny the request for 
authorization will be made available to you upon request. 
If the Medical Group does not authorize all of the 
Services requested and you want to appeal the decision, 
you can file a grievance as described under "Grievances" 
in the "Dispute Resolution" section. 
For these referral Services, you pay the Cost Share 
required for Services provided by a Plan Provider as 
described in this EOC. 
Travel and lodging for certain referrals 
The following are examples of when we will arrange or 
provide reimbursement for certain travel and lodging 
expenses in accord with our Travel and Lodging 
Program Description: 
•  If Medical Group refers you to a provider that is more 
than 50 miles from where you live for certain 
specialty Services such as bariatric surgery, complex 
thoracic surgery, transplant nephrectomy, or inpatient 
chemotherapy for leukemia and lymphoma 
•  If Medical Group refers you to a provider that is 
outside your Home Region Service Area for certain 
specialty Services such as a transplant or transgender 
surgery

Services" policy, please call our Member Service 
Contact Center. 
Second Opinions 
If you want a second opinion, you can ask Member 
Services to help you arrange one with a Plan Physician 
who is an appropriately qualified medical professional 
for your condition. If there isn't a Plan Physician who is 
an appropriately qualified medical professional for your 
condition, Member Services will help you arrange a 
consultation with a Non–Plan Physician for a second 
opinion. For purposes of this "Second Opinions" 
provision, an "appropriately qualified medical 
professional" is a physician who is acting within their 
scope of practice and who possesses a clinical 
background, including training and expertise, related to 
the illness or condition associated with the request for a 
second medical opinion. 
Here are some examples of when a second opinion may 
be provided or authorized: 
•  Your Plan Physician has recommended a procedure 
and you are unsure about whether the procedure is 
reasonable or necessary 
•  You question a diagnosis or plan of care for a 
condition that threatens substantial impairment or loss 
of life, limb, or bodily functions 
•  The clinical indications are not clear or are complex 
and confusing 
•  A diagnosis is in doubt due to conflicting test results 
•  The Plan Physician is unable to diagnose the 
condition 
•  The treatment plan in progress is not improving your 
medical condition within an appropriate period of 
time, given the diagnosis and plan of care 
•  You have concerns about the diagnosis or plan of care 
An authorization or denial of your request for a second 
opinion will be provided in an expeditious manner, as 
appropriate for your condition. If your request for a 
second opinion is denied, you will be notified in writing 
of the reasons for the denial and of your right to file a 
grievance as described under "Grievances" in the 
"Dispute Resolution" section. 
For these referral Services, you pay the Cost Share 
required for Services provided by a Plan Provider as 
described in this EOC. 
Contracts with Plan Providers 
How Plan Providers are paid 
Health Plan and Plan Providers are independent 
contractors. Plan Providers are paid in a number of ways, 
such as salary, capitation, per diem rates, case rates, fee 
for service, and incentive payments. To learn more about 
how Plan Physicians are paid to provide or arrange 
medical and hospital care for Members, please visit our 
website at kp.org or call our Member Service Contact 
Center. 
Financial liability 
Our contracts with Plan Providers provide that you are 
not liable for any amounts we owe. However, you may 
have to pay the full price of noncovered Services you 
obtain from Plan Providers or Non–Plan Providers. 
When you are referred to a Plan Provider for covered 
Services, you pay the Cost Share required for Services 
from that provider as described in this EOC. 
Breach of contract 
We will give you written notice within a reasonable time 
if any contracted provider breaches a contract with us, or 
is not able to provide contracted Services, if you might 
be materially and adversely affected. 
Termination of a Plan Provider's contract 
If our contract with any Plan Provider terminates while 
you are under the care of that provider, we will retain 
financial responsibility for the covered Services you 
receive from that provider until we make arrangements 
for the Services to be provided by another Plan Provider 
and notify you of the arrangements. You may be eligible 
to receive Services from a terminated provider; please 
refer to "Completion of Services from Non–Plan 
Providers" under "Getting a Referral" in this "How to 
Obtain Services" section. 
Provider groups and hospitals 
If you are assigned to a provider group or hospital whose 
contract with us terminates, or if you live within 15 miles 
of a hospital whose contract with us terminates, we will 
give you written notice at least 60 days before the 
termination (or as soon as reasonably possible).

Services" are Services that are covered under your Home 
Region plan that you receive in another Region, subject 
to exclusions, limitations, prior authorization or approval 
requirements, and reductions described in this EOC or

EOC. 
Receiving care outside of any Region 
If you are traveling outside of a Kaiser Permanente 
Region, we cover Emergency Services and Urgent Care 
as described in the "Emergency Services and Urgent 
Care" section. 
Your ID Card 
Each Member's Kaiser Permanente ID card has a medical 
record number on it, which you will need when you call 
for advice, make an appointment, or go to a provider for 
covered care. When you get care, please bring your ID 
card and a photo ID. Your medical record number is used 
to identify your medical records and membership 
information. Your medical record number should never 
change. Please call our Member Service Contact Center 
if we ever inadvertently issue you more than one medical 
record number or if you need to replace your ID card. 
Your ID card is for identification only. To receive 
covered Services, you must be a current Member. 
Anyone who is not a Member will be billed as a non-
Member for any Services they receive. If you let 
someone else use your ID card, we may keep your ID 
card and terminate your membership as described under 
"Termination for Cause" in the "Termination of 
Membership" section. 
Timely Access to Care 
Standards for appointment availability 
The California Department of Managed Health Care 
("DMHC") developed the following standards for 
appointment availability. This information can help you 
know what to expect when you request an appointment. 
•  Urgent Care: within 48 hours 
•  Nonurgent Primary Care Visit or Non-Physician 
Specialist Visit: within 10 business days 
•  Physician Specialist Visit: within 15 business days 
If you prefer to wait for a later appointment that will 
better fit your schedule or to see the Plan Provider of 
your choice, we will respect your preference. In some 
cases, your wait may be longer than the time listed if a 
licensed health care professional decides that a later 
appointment won't have a negative effect on your health. 
The standards for appointment availability do not apply 
to Preventive Services. Your Plan Provider may 
recommend a specific schedule for Preventive Services, 
depending on your needs. The standards also do not 
apply to periodic follow-up care for ongoing conditions 
or standing referrals to specialists. 
Timely access to telephone assistance 
DMHC developed the following standards for answering 
telephone questions: 
•  For telephone advice about whether you need to get 
care and where to get care: within 30 minutes, 24

•  For general questions: within 10 minutes during 
normal business hours

may authorize special transportation services that are 
medically required to get you to the provider. This may 
include transportation that is otherwise not covered. 
Please be aware that if a Service is covered but not 
available at a particular Plan Facility, we will make it 
available to you at another facility. 
Emergency Services and Urgent 
Care 
Emergency Services 
If you have an Emergency Medical Condition, call 911 
(where available) or go to the nearest hospital 
Emergency Department. You do not need prior 
authorization for Emergency Services. When you have 
an Emergency Medical Condition, we cover Emergency 
Services you receive from Plan Providers or Non–Plan 
Providers anywhere in the world. 
Emergency Services are available from Plan Hospital 
Emergency Departments 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week. 
Post-Stabilization Care 
Post-Stabilization Care is Medically Necessary Services 
related to your Emergency Medical Condition that you 
receive in a hospital (including the Emergency 
Department) after your treating physician determines that 
this condition is Stabilized. Post-Stabilization Care also 
includes durable medical equipment covered under this 
EOC, if it is Medically Necessary after discharge from a 
hospital, and related to the same Emergency Medical 
Condition. For more information about durable medical 
equipment covered under this EOC, see "Durable 
Medical Equipment ("DME") for Home Use" in the 
"Benefits" section. We cover Post-Stabilization Care 
from a Non–Plan Provider only if we provide prior 
authorization for the care or if otherwise required by 
applicable law ("prior authorization" means that we must 
approve the Services in advance). 
To request prior authorization, the Non–Plan Provider 
must call 1-800-225-8883 or the notification phone 
number on your Kaiser Permanente ID card before you 
receive the care. We will discuss your condition with the 
Non–Plan Provider. If we determine that you require 
Post-Stabilization Care and that this care is part of your 
covered benefits, we will authorize your care from the 
Non–Plan Provider or arrange to have a Plan Provider (or 
other designated provider) provide the care. If we decide 
to have a Plan Hospital, Plan Skilled Nursing Facility, or 
designated Non–Plan Provider provide your care, we 
Be sure to ask the Non–Plan Provider to tell you what 
care (including any transportation) we have authorized 
because we will not cover Post-Stabilization Care or 
related transportation provided by Non–Plan Providers 
that has not been authorized. If you receive care from a 
Non–Plan Provider that we have not authorized, you may 
have to pay the full cost of that care. If you are admitted 
to a Non–Plan Hospital, please notify us as soon as 
possible by calling 1-800-225-8883 or the notification 
phone number on your ID card. 
Your Cost Share 
Your Cost Share for covered Emergency Services and 
Post-Stabilization Care is described in the "Cost Share 
Summary" section of this EOC. Your Cost Share is the 
same whether you receive the Services from a Plan 
Provider or a Non–Plan Provider. For example: 
•  If you receive Emergency Services in the Emergency 
Department of a Non–Plan Hospital, you pay the Cost 
Share for an Emergency Department visit as 
described in the "Cost Share Summary" under 
"Emergency and Urgent Care visits" 
•  If we gave prior authorization for inpatient Post-
Stabilization Care in a Non–Plan Hospital, you pay 
the Cost Share for hospital inpatient care as described 
in the "Cost Share Summary" under "Hospital 
inpatient care" 
•  If we gave prior authorization for durable medical 
equipment after discharge from a Non–Plan Hospital, 
you pay the Cost Share for durable medical 
equipment as described in the "Cost Share Summary" 
under "Durable Medical Equipment ("DME") for 
home use" 
Urgent Care 
Inside the Service Area 
An Urgent Care need is one that requires prompt medical 
attention but is not an Emergency Medical Condition. If 
you think you may need Urgent Care, call the 
appropriate appointment or advice phone number at a 
Plan Facility. For appointment and advice phone 
numbers, refer to our Provider Directory or call our 
Member Service Contact Center. 
Out-of-Area Urgent Care 
If you need Urgent Care due to an unforeseen illness, 
unforeseen injury, or unforeseen complication of an 
existing condition (including pregnancy), we cover 
Medically Necessary Services to prevent serious

deterioration of your (or your unborn child's) health from 
a Non–Plan Provider if all of the following are true: 
under "Durable Medical Equipment ("DME") for 
home use" 
•  You receive the Services from Non–Plan Providers 
while you are temporarily outside your Home Region 
Service Area 
•  A reasonable person would have believed that your 
(or your unborn child's) health would seriously 
deteriorate if you delayed treatment until you returned 
to your Home Region Service Area 
You do not need prior authorization for Out-of-Area 
Urgent Care. We cover Out-of-Area Urgent Care you 
receive from Non–Plan Providers if the Services would 
have been covered under this EOC if you had received 
them from Plan Providers. 
To obtain follow-up care from a Plan Provider, call the 
appointment or advice phone number at a Plan Facility. 
For phone numbers, refer to our Provider Directory or 
call our Member Service Contact Center. We do not 
cover follow-up care from Non–Plan Providers after you 
no longer need Urgent Care, except for durable medical 
equipment covered under this EOC. For more 
information about durable medical equipment covered 
under this EOC, see "Durable Medical Equipment 
("DME") for Home Use" in the "Benefits" section. If you 
require durable medical equipment related to your 
Urgent Care after receiving Out-of-Area Urgent Care, 
your provider must obtain prior authorization as 
described under "Getting a Referral" in the "How to 
Obtain Services" section. 
Your Cost Share 
Your Cost Share for covered Urgent Care is the Cost 
Share required for Services provided by Plan Providers 
as described in the "Cost Share Summary" section of this 
EOC. For example: 
•  If you receive an Urgent Care evaluation as part of 
covered Out-of-Area Urgent Care from a Non–Plan 
Provider, you pay the Cost Share for Urgent Care 
consultations, evaluations, and treatment as described 
in the "Cost Share Summary" under "Emergency and 
Urgent Care visits" 
•  If the Out-of-Area Urgent Care you receive includes 
an X-ray, you pay the Cost Share for an X-ray as 
described in the "Cost Share Summary" under 
"Outpatient imaging, laboratory, and other diagnostic 
and treatment Services," in addition to the Cost Share 
for the Urgent Care evaluation 
•  If we gave prior authorization for durable medical 
equipment provided as part of Out-of-Area Urgent 
Care, you pay the Cost Share for durable medical 
equipment as described in the "Cost Share Summary" 
Note: If you receive Urgent Care in an Emergency 
Department, you pay the Cost Share for an Emergency 
Department visit as described in the "Cost Share 
Summary" under "Emergency and Urgent Care visits." 
Payment and Reimbursement 
If you receive Emergency Services, Post-Stabilization 
Care, or Out-of-Area Urgent Care from a Non–Plan 
Provider as described in this "Emergency Services and 
Urgent Care" section, or emergency ambulance Services 
described under "Ambulance Services" in the "Benefits" 
section, you are not responsible for any amounts beyond 
your Cost Share for covered Emergency Services. 
However, if the provider does not agree to bill us, you 
may have to pay for the Services and file a claim for 
reimbursement. Also, you may be required to pay and 
file a claim for any Services prescribed by a Non–Plan 
Provider as part of covered Emergency Services, Post-
Stabilization Care, and Out-of-Area Urgent Care even if 
you receive the Services from a Plan Provider, such as a 
Plan Pharmacy. 
We will reduce any payment we make to you or the 
Non–Plan Provider by applicable Cost Share. Also, we 
will reduce our payment by any amounts paid or payable 
(or that in the absence of this plan would have been 
payable) for the Services under any insurance policy, or 
any other contract or coverage, or any government 
program except Medicaid. If payment under the other 
insurance or program is not made within a reasonable 
period of time, we will pay for covered Emergency 
Services, Post-Stabilization Care, and Out-of-Area 
Urgent Care received from Non–Plan Providers if you: 
•  Assign all rights to payment to us and agree to 
cooperate with us in obtaining payment 
•  Allow us to obtain any relevant information from the 
other insurance or program 
•  Provide us with any information and assistance we 
need to obtain payment from the other insurance or 
program

Your Cost Share 
Your Cost Share is the amount you are required to pay 
for covered Services. For example, your Cost Share may 
be a Copayment or Coinsurance. 
If your coverage includes a Plan Deductible and you 
receive Services that are subject to the Plan Deductible, 
your Cost Share for those Services will be Charges until 
you reach the Plan Deductible. Similarly, if your 
coverage includes a Drug Deductible, and you receive 
Services that are subject to the Drug Deductible, your 
Cost Share for those Services will be Charges until you 
reach the Drug Deductible. 
Please refer to the "Cost Share Summary" section of this 
EOC for the amount you will pay for Services. 
General rules, examples, and exceptions 
Your Cost Share for covered Services will be the Cost 
Share in effect on the date you receive the Services, 
except as follows: 
•  If you are receiving covered inpatient hospital or 
Skilled Nursing Facility Services on the effective date 
of this EOC, you pay the Cost Share in effect on your 
admission date until you are discharged if the 
Services were covered under your prior Health Plan 
evidence of coverage and there has been no break in 
coverage. However, if the Services were not covered 
under your prior Health Plan evidence of coverage, or 
if there has been a break in coverage, you pay the 
Cost Share in effect on the date you receive the 
Services 
•  For items ordered in advance, you pay the Cost Share 
in effect on the order date (although we will not cover

the item unless you still have coverage for it on the 
date you receive it) and you may be required to pay 
the Cost Share when the item is ordered. For 
outpatient prescription drugs, the order date is the 
date that the pharmacy processes the order after 
receiving all of the information they need to fill the 
prescription 
Cost Share for Services received by newborn children 
of a Member 
During the 31 days of automatic coverage for newborn 
children described under "Newborn coverage" under 
"Who Is Eligible" in the "Premiums, Eligibility, and 
Enrollment" section, the parent or guardian of the 
newborn must pay the Cost Share indicated in the "Cost 
Share Summary" section of this EOC for any Services 
that the newborn receives, whether or not the newborn is 
enrolled. When the "Cost Share Summary" indicates the 
Services are subject to the Plan Deductible, the Cost 
Share for those Services will be Charges if the newborn 
has not met the Plan Deductible. 
Payment toward your Cost Share (and when you may 
be billed) 
In most cases, your provider will ask you to make a 
payment toward your Cost Share at the time you receive 
Services. If you receive more than one type of Services 
(such as a routine physical maintenance exam and 
laboratory tests), you may be required to pay separate 
Cost Share for each of those Services. Keep in mind that 
your payment toward your Cost Share may cover only a 
portion of your total Cost Share for the Services you 
receive, and you will be billed for any additional 
amounts that are due. The following are examples of 
when you may be asked to pay (or you may be billed for) 
Cost Share amounts in addition to the amount you pay at 
check-in: 
•  You receive non-preventive Services during a 
preventive visit. For example, you go in for a routine 
physical maintenance exam, and at check-in you pay 
your Cost Share for the preventive exam (your Cost 
Share may be "no charge"). However, during your 
preventive exam your provider finds a problem with 
your health and orders non-preventive Services to 
diagnose your problem (such as laboratory tests). You 
may be asked to pay (or you will be billed for) your 
Cost Share for these additional non-preventive 
diagnostic Services 
•  You receive diagnostic Services during a treatment 
visit. For example, you go in for treatment of an 
existing health condition, and at check-in you pay 
your Cost Share for a treatment visit. However, 
during the visit your provider finds a new problem 
with your health and performs or orders diagnostic 
Services (such as laboratory tests). You may be asked 
to pay (or you will be billed for) your Cost Share for 
these additional diagnostic Services 
•  You receive treatment Services during a diagnostic 
visit. For example, you go in for a diagnostic exam, 
and at check-in you pay your Cost Share for a 
diagnostic exam. However, during the diagnostic 
exam your provider confirms a problem with your 
health and performs treatment Services (such as an 
outpatient procedure). You may be asked to pay (or 
you will be billed for) your Cost Share for these 
additional treatment Services 
•  You receive Services from a second provider during 
your visit. For example, you go in for a diagnostic 
exam, and at check-in you pay your Cost Share for a 
diagnostic exam. However, during the diagnostic 
exam your provider requests a consultation with a 
specialist. You may be asked to pay (or you will be 
billed for) your Cost Share for the consultation with 
the specialist 
In some cases, your provider will not ask you to make a 
payment at the time you receive Services, and you will 
be billed for your Cost Share (for example, some 
Laboratory Departments are not able to collect Cost 
Share, or your Plan Provider is not able to collect Cost 
Share, if any, for Telehealth Visits you receive at home). 
When we send you a bill, it will list Charges for the 
Services you received, payments and credits applied to 
your account, and any amounts you still owe. Your 
current bill may not always reflect your most recent 
Charges and payments. Any Charges and payments that 
are not on the current bill will appear on a future bill. 
Sometimes, you may see a payment but not the related 
Charges for Services. That could be because your 
payment was recorded before the Charges for the 
Services were processed. If so, the Charges will appear 
on a future bill. Also, you may receive more than one bill 
for a single outpatient visit or inpatient stay. For 
example, you may receive a bill for physician services 
and a separate bill for hospital services. If you don't see 
all the Charges for Services on one bill, they will appear 
on a future bill. If we determine that you overpaid and 
are due a refund, then we will send a refund to you 
within four weeks after we make that determination. If 
you have questions about a bill, please call the phone 
number on the bill. 
In some cases, a Non–Plan Provider may be involved in 
the provision of covered Services at a Plan Facility or a 
contracted facility where we have authorized you to 
receive care. You are not responsible for any amounts 
beyond your Cost Share for the covered Services you 
receive at Plan Facilities or at contracted facilities where 
we have authorized you to receive care. However, if the

for the Services and file a claim for reimbursement. For 
information on how to file a claim, please see the "Post-
Service Claims and Appeals" section. 
Primary Care Visits, Non-Physician Specialist Visits, 
and Physician Specialist Visits 
The Cost Share for a Primary Care Visit applies to 
evaluations and treatment provided by generalists in 
internal medicine, pediatrics, or family practice, and by 
specialists in obstetrics/gynecology whom the Medical 
Group designates as Primary Care Physicians. Some 
physician specialists provide primary care in addition to 
specialty care but are not designated as Primary Care 
Physicians. If you receive Services from one of these 
specialists, the Cost Share for a Physician Specialist Visit 
will apply to all consultations, evaluations, and treatment 
provided by the specialist except for routine preventive 
counseling and exams listed under "Preventive Services" 
in this "Benefits" section. For example, if your personal 
Plan Physician is a specialist in internal medicine or 
obstetrics/gynecology who is not a Primary Care 
Physician, you will pay the Cost Share for a Physician 
Specialist Visit for all consultations, evaluations, and 
treatment by the specialist except routine preventive 
counseling and exams listed under "Preventive Services" 
in this "Benefits" section. The Non-Physician Specialist 
Visit Cost Share applies to consultations, evaluations, 
and treatment provided by non-physician specialists 
(such as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, 
optometrists, podiatrists, and audiologists). 
Noncovered Services 
If you receive Services that are not covered under this 
EOC, you may have to pay the full price of those 
Services. Payments you make for noncovered Services 
do not apply to any deductible or out-of-pocket 
maximum. 
Benefit limits 
Some benefits may include a limit on the number of 
visits, days, or dollar amount that will be covered under 
your plan during a specified time period. If a benefit 
includes a limit, this will be indicated in the "Cost Share 
Summary" section of this EOC. The time period 
associated with a benefit limit may not be the same as the 
term of this EOC. We will count all Services you receive 
during the benefit limit period toward the benefit limit, 
including Services you received under a prior Health 
Plan EOC (as long as you have continuous coverage with 
Health Plan). Note: We will not count Services you 
received under a prior Health Plan EOC when you first 
enroll in individual plan coverage or a new employer 
group's plan, when you move from group to individual 
plan coverage (or vice versa), or when you received 
Services under a Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage 
evidence of coverage. If you are enrolled in the Kaiser 
Permanente POS Plan, refer to your KPIC Certificate of 
Insurance and Schedule of Coverage for benefit limits 
that apply to your separate indemnity coverage provided 
by the Kaiser Permanente Insurance Company ("KPIC"). 
Getting an estimate of your Cost Share 
If you have questions about the Cost Share for specific 
Services that you expect to receive or that your provider 
orders during a visit or procedure, please visit our 
website at kp.org/memberestimates to use our cost 
estimate tool or call our Member Service Contact Center. 
•  If you have a Plan Deductible and would like an 
estimate for Services that are subject to the Plan 
Deductible, please call 1-800-390-3507 (TTY users 
call 711) Monday through Friday 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Refer to the "Cost Share Summary" section of this

•  For all other Cost Share estimates, please call 1-800-
464-4000 (TTY users call 711) 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week (except closed holidays) 
Cost Share estimates are based on your benefits and the 
Services you expect to receive. They are a prediction of 
cost and not a guarantee of the final cost of Services. 
Your final cost may be higher or lower than the estimate 
since not everything about your care can be known in 
advance. 
Drug Deductible 
This EOC does not include a Drug Deductible. 
Plan Deductible 
This EOC does not include a Plan Deductible. 
Copayments and Coinsurance 
The Copayment or Coinsurance you must pay for each 
covered Service, after you meet any applicable 
deductible, is described in this EOC. 
Note: If Charges for Services are less than the 
Copayment described in this EOC, you will pay the 
lesser amount, subject to any applicable deductible or 
out-of-pocket maximum. 
Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum 
There is a limit to the total amount of Cost Share you 
must pay under this EOC in the Accumulation Period for 
covered Services that you receive in the same 
Accumulation Period. The Services that apply to the Plan 
Out-of-Pocket Maximum are described under the 
"Payments that count toward the Plan Out-of-Pocket

Share Summary" section of this EOC for your applicable 
Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum amounts. 
If you are a Member in a Family of two or more 
Members, you reach the Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum 
either when you reach the maximum for any one 
Member, or when your Family reaches the Family 
maximum. For example, suppose you have reached the 
Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum for any one Member. For 
Services subject to the Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum, 
you will not pay any more Cost Share during the 
remainder of the Accumulation Period, but every other 
Member in your Family must continue to pay Cost Share 
during the remainder of the Accumulation Period until 
either they reach the maximum for any one Member or 
your Family reaches the Family maximum. 
Payments that count toward the Plan Out-of-Pocket 
Maximum 
Any payments you make toward the Plan Deductible or 
Drug Deductible, if applicable, apply toward the 
maximum. 
Most Copayments and Coinsurance you pay for covered 
Services apply to the maximum, however some may not. 
To find out whether a Copayment or Coinsurance for a 
covered Service will apply to the maximum please refer 
to the "Cost Share Summary" section of this EOC. 
If your plan includes pediatric dental Services described 
in a Pediatric Dental Services Amendment to this EOC, 
those Services will apply toward the maximum. If your 
plan has a Pediatric Dental Services Amendment, it will 
be attached to this EOC, and it will be listed in the EOC's 
Table of Contents. 
Keeping track of the Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum 
When you receive Services, we will give you a receipt 
that shows how much you paid. To see how close you 
are to reaching your Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum, use 
our online Out-of-Pocket Summary tool at

Administered Drugs and Products 
Administered drugs and products are medications and 
products that require administration or observation by 
medical personnel, such as: 
•  Whole blood, red blood cells, plasma, and platelets 
•  Allergy antigens (including administration) 
•  Cancer chemotherapy drugs and adjuncts 
•  Drugs and products that are administered via 
intravenous therapy or injection that are not for 
cancer chemotherapy, including blood factor products 
and biological products ("biologics") derived from 
tissue, cells, or blood 
•  Other administered drugs and products 
We cover these items when prescribed by a Plan 
Provider, in accord with our drug formulary guidelines, 
and they are administered to you in a Plan Facility or 
during home visits. 
Certain administered drugs are Preventive Services. 
Please refer to "Family Planning Services" for 
information about administered contraceptives and refer 
to "Preventive Services" for information on 
immunizations. 
Ambulance Services 
Emergency 
We cover Services of a licensed ambulance anywhere in 
the world without prior authorization (including 
transportation through the 911 emergency response 
system where available) in the following situations: 
•  You reasonably believed that the medical condition 
was an Emergency Medical Condition which required 
ambulance Services 
•  Your treating physician determines that you must be 
transported to another facility because your 
Emergency Medical Condition is not Stabilized and 
the care you need is not available at the treating 
facility 
If you receive emergency ambulance Services that are 
not ordered by a Plan Provider, you are not responsible 
for any amounts beyond your Cost Share for covered 
emergency ambulance Services. However, if the provider 
does not agree to bill us, you may have to pay for the 
Services and file a claim for reimbursement. For 
information on how to file a claim, please see the "Post-
Service Claims and Appeals" section. 
Nonemergency 
Inside your Home Region Service Area, we cover 
nonemergency ambulance and psychiatric transport van 
Services if a Plan Physician determines that your

period if the pharmacy determines that the item is in 
limited supply in the market or for specific drugs (your 
Plan Pharmacy can tell you if a drug you take is one of 
these drugs). 
About the drug formulary 
The drug formulary includes a list of drugs that our 
Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee has approved for 
our Members. Our Pharmacy and Therapeutics 
Committee, which is primarily composed of Plan 
Physicians and pharmacists, selects drugs for the drug 
formulary based on several factors, including safety and 
effectiveness as determined from a review of medical 
literature. The drug formulary is updated monthly based 
on new information or new drugs that become available. 
To find out which drugs are on the formulary for your 
plan, please visit our website at kp.org/formulary. If 
you would like to request a copy of the drug formulary 
for your plan, please call our Member Service Contact 
Center. Note: The presence of a drug on the drug 
formulary does not necessarily mean that it will be 
prescribed for a particular medical condition. 
Formulary exception process 
Drug formulary guidelines allow you to obtain a non-
formulary prescription drug (those not listed on our drug 
formulary for your condition) if it would otherwise be 
covered by your plan, as described above, and it is 
Medically Necessary. If you disagree with a Health Plan 
determination that a non-formulary prescription drug is 
not covered, you may file a grievance as described in the 
"Dispute Resolution" section. 
Continuity drugs 
If this EOC is amended to exclude a drug that we have 
been covering and providing to you under this EOC, we 
will continue to provide the drug if a prescription is 
required by law and a Plan Physician continues to 
prescribe the drug for the same condition and for a use 
approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration. 
About drug tiers 
Drugs on the drug formulary are categorized into one of 
three tiers, as described in the table below. Your Cost 
Share for covered items may vary based on the tier. 
Please refer to "Outpatient prescription drugs, supplies, 
and supplements" in the "Cost Share Summary" section 
of this EOC for Cost Share for items covered under this 
section. 
For the locations of Plan Pharmacies, refer to our 
Provider Directory or call our Member Service Contact 
Center. 
Refills 
You may be able to order refills at a Plan Pharmacy, 
through our mail-order service, or through our website at 
kp.org/rxrefill. A Plan Pharmacy can give you more 
information about obtaining refills, including the options 
available to you for obtaining refills. For example, a few 
Plan Pharmacies don't dispense refills and not all drugs 
can be mailed through our mail-order service. Please 
check with a Plan Pharmacy if you have a question about 
whether your prescription can be mailed or obtained at a 
Plan Pharmacy. Items available through our mail-order 
service are subject to change at any time without notice. 
Day supply limit 
The prescribing physician or dentist determines how 
much of a drug, supply, or supplement to prescribe. For 
purposes of day supply coverage limits, Plan Physicians 
determine the amount of an item that constitutes a 
Medically Necessary 30- or 100-day supply (or 365-day 
supply if the item is a hormonal contraceptive) for you. 
Upon payment of the Cost Share specified in the 
"Outpatient prescription drugs, supplies, and 
supplements" section of the "Cost Share Summary," you 
will receive the supply prescribed up to the day supply 
limit also specified in this section. The maximum you 
may receive at one time of a covered item, other than a 
hormonal contraceptive, is either one 30-day supply in a 
30-day period or one 100-day supply in a 100-day 
period. If you wish to receive more than the covered day 
supply limit, then you must pay Charges for any 
prescribed quantities that exceed the day supply limit. 
If your plan includes coverage for hormonal 
contraceptives, the maximum you may receive at one 
time of contraceptive drugs is a 365-day supply. Refer to 
the "Cost Share Summary" section of this EOC to find 
out if your plan includes coverage for hormonal 
contraceptives. 
If your plan includes coverage for sexual dysfunction 
drugs, the maximum you may receive at one time of 
episodic drugs prescribed for the treatment of sexual 
dysfunction disorders is eight doses in any 30-day period 
or up to 27 doses in any 100-day period. Refer to the 
"Cost Share Summary" section of this EOC to find out if 
your plan includes coverage for sexual dysfunction 
drugs.

non-formulary drugs as you would for formulary drugs, 
when approved through the formulary exception process 
described above (the generic drugs, brand drugs, or 
specialty drugs Cost Share will apply, as applicable). 
About specialty drugs 
Specialty drugs (Tier 4) are high-cost drugs that are on 
our specialty drug list. To obtain a list of specialty drugs 
that are on our formulary, or to find out if a non-
formulary drug is on the specialty drugs tier, please call 
our Member Service Contact Center. If your Plan 
Physician prescribes more than a 30-day supply for an 
outpatient drug, you may be able to obtain more than a 
30-day supply at one time, up to the day supply limit for 
that drug. However, most specialty drugs are limited to a 
30-day supply in any 30-day period. Your Plan 
Pharmacy can tell you if a drug you take is one of these 
drugs. 
General rules about coverage and your Cost 
Share 
We cover the following outpatient drugs, supplies, and 
supplements as described in this "Outpatient Prescription 
Drugs, Supplies, and Supplements" section:

also cover certain drugs that do not require a 
prescription by law if they are listed on our drug 
formulary 
•  Disposable needles and syringes needed for injecting 
covered drugs and supplements 
•  Inhaler spacers needed to inhale covered drugs 
Note: 
•  If Charges for the drug, supply, or supplement are less 
than the Copayment, you will pay the lesser amount, 
subject to any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket 
maximum 
•  Items can change tier at any time, in accord with 
formulary guidelines, which may impact your Cost 
Share (for example, if a brand-name drug is added to 
the specialty drug list, you will pay the Cost Share 
that applies to drugs on the specialty drugs tier (Tier 
4), not the Cost Share for drugs on the brand drugs 
tier (Tier 2)) 
Schedule II drugs 
You or the prescribing provider can request that the 
pharmacy dispense less than the prescribed amount of a 
covered oral, solid dosage form of a Schedule II drug 
(your Plan Pharmacy can tell you if a drug you take is 
one of these drugs). Your Cost Share will be prorated 
based on the amount of the drug that is dispensed. If the 
pharmacy does not prorate your Cost Share, we will send 
you a refund for the difference. 
Mail-order service 
Prescription refills can be mailed within 7 to 10 days at 
no extra cost for standard U.S. postage. The appropriate 
Cost Share (according to your drug coverage) will apply 
and must be charged to a valid credit card. 
You may request mail-order service in the following 
ways: 
•  To order online, visit kp.org/rxrefill (you can register 
for a secure account at kp.org/registernow) or use

first, or is "primary," and which coverage pays second, or

request to help us coordinate benefits. Please call our 
Member Service Contact Center to find out which 
Medicare rules apply to your situation, and how payment 
will be handled.

If you obtain a judgment or settlement from or on behalf 
of a third party who allegedly caused an injury or illness 
for which you received covered Services, you must 
reimburse us to the maximum extent allowed under 
California Civil Code Section 3040. Note: This "Injuries 
or illnesses alleged to be caused by third parties" section 
does not affect your obligation to pay your Cost Share 
for these Services. 
To the extent permitted or required by law, we have the 
option of becoming subrogated to all claims, causes of 
action, and other rights you may have against a third 
party or an insurer, government program, or other source 
of coverage for monetary damages, compensation, or 
indemnification on account of the injury or illness 
allegedly caused by the third party. We will be so 
subrogated as of the time we mail or deliver a written 
notice of our exercise of this option to you or your 
attorney. 
To secure our rights, we will have a lien on the proceeds 
of any judgment or settlement you or we obtain against a

third party. The proceeds of any judgment or settlement 
that you or we obtain shall first be applied to satisfy our 
lien, regardless of whether the total amount of the 
proceeds is less than the actual losses and damages you 
incurred. 
Within 30 days after submitting or filing a claim or legal 
action against a third party, you must send written notice 
of the claim or legal action to:

In order for us to determine the existence of any rights 
we may have and to satisfy those rights, you must 
complete and send us all consents, releases, 
authorizations, assignments, and other documents, 
including lien forms directing your attorney, the third 
party, and the third party's liability insurer to pay us 
directly. You may not agree to waive, release, or reduce 
our rights under this provision without our prior, written 
consent. 
If your estate, parent, guardian, or conservator asserts a 
claim against a third party based on your injury or 
illness, your estate, parent, guardian, or conservator and 
any settlement or judgment recovered by the estate, 
parent, guardian, or conservator shall be subject to our 
liens and other rights to the same extent as if you had 
asserted the claim against the third party. We may assign 
our rights to enforce our liens and other rights. 
If you have Medicare, Medicare law may apply with 
respect to Services covered by Medicare. 
Some providers have contracted with Kaiser Permanente 
to provide certain Services to Members at rates that are 
typically less than the fees that the providers ordinarily 
charge to the general public ("General Fees"). However, 
these contracts may allow the providers to recover all or 
a portion of the difference between the fees paid by 
Kaiser Permanente and their General Fees by means of a 
lien claim under California Civil Code Sections 3045.1–
3045.6 against a judgment or settlement that you receive 
from or on behalf of a third party. For Services the 
provider furnished, our recovery and the provider's 
recovery together will not exceed the provider's General 
Fees. 
Surrogacy arrangements 
If you enter into a Surrogacy Arrangement and you or 
any other payee are entitled to receive payments or other 
compensation under the Surrogacy Arrangement, you 
must reimburse us for covered Services you receive 
related to conception, pregnancy, delivery, or postpartum 
care in connection with that arrangement ("Surrogacy 
Health Services") to the maximum extent allowed under 
California Civil Code Section 3040. A "Surrogacy 
Arrangement" is one in which a woman agrees to 
become pregnant and to surrender the baby (or babies) to 
another person or persons who intend to raise the child 
(or children), whether or not the woman receives 
payment for being a surrogate. Note: This "Surrogacy 
arrangements" section does not affect your obligation to 
pay your Cost Share for these Services. After you 
surrender a baby to the legal parents, you are not 
obligated to reimburse us for any Services that the baby 
receives (the legal parents are financially responsible for 
any Services that the baby receives). 
By accepting Surrogacy Health Services, you 
automatically assign to us your right to receive payments 
that are payable to you or any other payee under the 
Surrogacy Arrangement, regardless of whether those 
payments are characterized as being for medical 
expenses. To secure our rights, we will also have a lien 
on those payments and on any escrow account, trust, or 
any other account that holds those payments. Those 
payments (and amounts in any escrow account, trust, or 
other account that holds those payments) shall first be 
applied to satisfy our lien. The assignment and our lien 
will not exceed the total amount of your obligation to us 
under the preceding paragraph. 
Within 30 days after entering into a Surrogacy 
Arrangement, you must send written notice of the 
arrangement, including all of the following information: 
•  Names, addresses, and phone numbers of the other 
parties to the arrangement 
•  Names, addresses, and phone numbers of any escrow 
agent or trustee 
•  Names, addresses, and phone numbers of the intended 
parents and any other parties who are financially 
responsible for Services the baby (or babies) receive, 
including names, addresses, and phone numbers for 
any health insurance that will cover Services that the 
baby (or babies) receive

we may recover the value of the Services from the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.

including amounts received as a settlement (collectively 
referred to as "Financial Benefit"), under workers'

recover the value of any covered Services from the 
following sources: 
•  From any source providing a Financial Benefit or 
from whom a Financial Benefit is due

We will decide whether your grievance is urgent or non-
urgent unless your attending health care provider tells us 
your grievance is urgent. If we determine that your 
grievance is not urgent, we will use the procedure 
described under "Standard procedure" in this 
"Grievances" section. Generally, a grievance is urgent 
only if one of the following is true: 
•  Using the standard procedure could seriously 
jeopardize your life, health, or ability to regain 
maximum function 
•  Using the standard procedure would, in the opinion of 
a physician with knowledge of your medical 
condition, subject you to severe pain that cannot be 
adequately managed without extending your course of 
covered treatment 
•  A physician with knowledge of your medical 
condition determines that your grievance is urgent 
•  You have received Emergency Services but have not 
been discharged from a facility and your request 
involves admissions, continued stay, or other health 
care Services 
•  You are undergoing a current course of treatment 
using a non-formulary prescription drug and your 
grievance involves a request to refill a non-formulary 
prescription drug 
For most grievances that we respond to on an urgent 
basis, we will give you oral notice of our decision as 
soon as your clinical condition requires, but not later 
than 72 hours after we received your grievance. We will 
send you a written confirmation of our decision within 
three days after we received your grievance. 
If your grievance involves a request to obtain a non-
formulary prescription drug and we respond to your 
request on an urgent basis, we will notify you of our 
decision within 24 hours of your request. For information 
on how to request a review by an independent review

reviewer's decision to you within 72 hours. If the 
independent reviewer does not decide in your favor, you 
may submit a complaint to the Department of Managed 
Health Care, as described under "Department of 
Managed Health Care Complaints" in this "Dispute 
Resolution" section. You may also submit a request for 
an Independent Medical Review as described under 
"Independent Medical Review" in this "Dispute 
Resolution" section. 
Department of Managed Health Care 
Complaints 
The California Department of Managed Health Care is 
responsible for regulating health care service plans. If 
you have a grievance against your health plan, you 
should first telephone your health plan toll free at 
1-800-464-4000 (TTY users call 711) and use your 
health plan's grievance process before contacting the 
department. Utilizing this grievance procedure does not 
prohibit any potential legal rights or remedies that may 
be available to you. If you need help with a grievance 
involving an emergency, a grievance that has not been 
satisfactorily resolved by your health plan, or a grievance 
that has remained unresolved for more than 30 days, you 
may call the department for assistance. You may also be 
eligible for an Independent Medical Review (IMR). If 
you are eligible for IMR, the IMR process will provide 
an impartial review of medical decisions made by a 
health plan related to the medical necessity of a proposed 
service or treatment, coverage decisions for treatments 
that are experimental or investigational in nature and 
payment disputes for emergency or urgent medical 
services. The department also has a toll-free telephone 
number (1-888-466-2219) and a TDD line 
(1-877-688-9891) for the hearing and speech 
impaired. The department's Internet website 
www.dmhc.ca.gov has complaint forms, IMR 
application forms and instructions online. 
Independent Medical Review ("IMR") 
Except as described in this "Independent Medical 
Review ("IMR")" section, you must exhaust our internal 
grievance procedure before you may request independent 
medical review unless we have failed to comply with the 
grievance procedure described under "Grievances" in this 
"Dispute Resolution" section. If you qualify, you or your 
authorized representative may have your issue reviewed 
through the IMR process managed by the California 
Department of Managed Health Care ("DMHC"). The 
DMHC determines which cases qualify for IMR. This 
review is at no cost to you. If you decide not to request 
an IMR, you may give up the right to pursue some legal 
actions against us. 
You may qualify for IMR if all of the following are true: 
•  One of these situations applies to you: 
  you have a recommendation from a provider 
requesting Medically Necessary Services 
  you have received Emergency Services, 
emergency ambulance Services, or Urgent Care 
from a provider who determined the Services to be 
Medically Necessary 
  you have been seen by a Plan Provider for the 
diagnosis or treatment of your medical condition 
•  Your request for payment or Services has been 
denied, modified, or delayed based in whole or in part 
on a decision that the Services are not Medically 
Necessary 
•  You have filed a grievance and we have denied it or 
we haven't made a decision about your grievance 
within 30 days (or three days for urgent grievances). 
The DMHC may waive the requirement that you first 
file a grievance with us in extraordinary and 
compelling cases, such as severe pain or potential loss 
of life, limb, or major bodily function. If we have 
denied your grievance, you must submit your request 
for an IMR within six months of the date of our 
written denial. However, the DMHC may accept your 
request after six months if they determine that 
circumstances prevented timely submission 
You may also qualify for IMR if the Service you 
requested has been denied on the basis that it is 
experimental or investigational as described under 
"Experimental or investigational denials." 
If the DMHC determines that your case is eligible for 
IMR, it will ask us to send your case to the DMHC's 
IMR organization. The DMHC will promptly notify you 
of its decision after it receives the IMR organization's 
determination. If the decision is in your favor, we will 
contact you to arrange for the Service or payment. 
Experimental or investigational denials 
If we deny a Service because it is experimental or 
investigational, we will send you our written explanation 
within three days after we received your request. We will 
explain why we denied the Service and provide 
additional dispute resolution options. Also, we will 
provide information about your right to request 
Independent Medical Review if we had the following 
information when we made our decision: 
•  Your treating physician provided us a written 
statement that you have a life-threatening or seriously 
Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families 
2021 Kaiser Permanente – Platinum 90 HMO

debilitating condition and that standard therapies have 
not been effective in improving your condition, or 
that standard therapies would not be appropriate, or 
that there is no more beneficial standard therapy we 
cover than the therapy being requested. "Life-
threatening" means diseases or conditions where the 
likelihood of death is high unless the course of the 
disease is interrupted, or diseases or conditions with 
potentially fatal outcomes where the end point of 
clinical intervention is survival. "Seriously 
debilitating" means diseases or conditions that cause 
major irreversible morbidity 
•  If your treating physician is a Plan Physician, they 
recommended a treatment, drug, device, procedure, or 
other therapy and certified that the requested therapy 
is likely to be more beneficial to you than any 
available standard therapies and included a statement 
of the evidence relied upon by the Plan Physician in 
certifying their recommendation 
•  You (or your Non–Plan Physician who is a licensed, 
and either a board-certified or board-eligible, 
physician qualified in the area of practice appropriate 
to treat your condition) requested a therapy that, 
based on two documents from the medical and 
scientific evidence, as defined in California Health 
and Safety Code Section 1370.4(d), is likely to be 
more beneficial for you than any available standard 
therapy. The physician's certification included a 
statement of the evidence relied upon by the 
physician in certifying their recommendation. We do 
not cover the Services of the Non–Plan Provider 
Note: You can request IMR for experimental or 
investigational denials at any time without first filing a 
grievance with us. 
Office of Civil Rights Complaints 
If you believe that you have been discriminated against 
by a Plan Provider or by us because of your race, color, 
national origin, disability, age, sex (including sex 
stereotyping and gender identity), or religion, you may 
file a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights in the 
United States Department of Health and Human Services 
("OCR"). 
You may file your complaint with the OCR within 180 
days of when you believe the act of discrimination 
occurred. However, the OCR may accept your request 
after six months if they determine that circumstances 
prevented timely submission. For more information on 
the OCR and how to file a complaint with the OCR, go 
to hhs.gov/civil-rights. 
Additional Review 
You may have a right to request review in state court if 
you remain dissatisfied after you have exhausted our 
internal claims and appeals procedure, and if applicable, 
external review. 
Binding Arbitration 
For all claims subject to this "Binding Arbitration" 
section, both Claimants and Respondents give up the 
right to a jury or court trial and accept the use of binding 
arbitration. Insofar as this "Binding Arbitration" section 
applies to claims asserted by Kaiser Permanente Parties, 
it shall apply retroactively to all unresolved claims that 
accrued before the effective date of this EOC. Such 
retroactive application shall be binding only on the 
Kaiser Permanente Parties. 
Scope of arbitration 
Any dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration if 
all of the following requirements are met: 
•  The claim arises from or is related to an alleged 
violation of any duty incident to or arising out of or 
relating to this EOC or a Member Party's relationship 
to Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. ("Health 
Plan"), including any claim for medical or hospital 
malpractice (a claim that medical services or items 
were unnecessary or unauthorized or were 
improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered), 
for premises liability, or relating to the coverage for, 
or delivery of, services or items, irrespective of the 
legal theories upon which the claim is asserted 
•  The claim is asserted by one or more Member Parties 
against one or more Kaiser Permanente Parties or by 
one or more Kaiser Permanente Parties against one or 
more Member Parties 
•  Governing law does not prevent the use of binding 
arbitration to resolve the claim 
Members enrolled under this EOC thus give up their 
right to a court or jury trial, and instead accept the use of 
binding arbitration except that the following types of 
claims are not subject to binding arbitration: 
•  Claims within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims 
Court 
•  Claims subject to a Medicare appeal procedure as 
applicable to Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage 
Members 
•  Claims that cannot be subject to binding arbitration 
under governing law

shall be served with a Demand for Arbitration by mailing 
the Demand for Arbitration addressed to that Respondent 
in care of: 
For Northern California Home Region Members: 
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. 
Legal Department 
1950 Franklin St., 17th Floor 
Oakland, CA 94612 
For Southern California Home Region Members: 
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.

393 E. Walnut St. 
Pasadena, CA 91188 
Service on that Respondent shall be deemed completed 
when received. All other Respondents, including 
individuals, must be served as required by the California 
Code of Civil Procedure for a civil action. 
Filing fee 
The Claimants shall pay a single, nonrefundable filing 
fee of $150 per arbitration payable to "Arbitration 
Account" regardless of the number of claims asserted in 
the Demand for Arbitration or the number of Claimants 
or Respondents named in the Demand for Arbitration. 
Any Claimant who claims extreme hardship may request 
that the Office of the Independent Administrator waive 
the filing fee and the neutral arbitrator's fees and 
expenses. A Claimant who seeks such waivers shall 
complete the Fee Waiver Form and submit it to the 
Office of the Independent Administrator and 
simultaneously serve it upon the Respondents. The Fee 
Waiver Form sets forth the criteria for waiving fees and 
is available by calling our Member Service Contact 
Center. 
Number of arbitrators 
The number of arbitrators may affect the Claimants' 
responsibility for paying the neutral arbitrator's fees and 
expenses (see the Rules of Procedure). 
If the Demand for Arbitration seeks total damages of 
$200,000 or less, the dispute shall be heard and 
determined by one neutral arbitrator, unless the parties 
otherwise agree in writing after a dispute has arisen and a

2021 Kaiser Permanente – Platinum 90 HMO                                                                                                 
Date: July 28, 2020 
Page 74 
request for binding arbitration has been submitted that 
the arbitration shall be heard by two party arbitrators and 
one neutral arbitrator. The neutral arbitrator shall not 
have authority to award monetary damages that are 
greater than $200,000. 
If the Demand for Arbitration seeks total damages of 
more than $200,000, the dispute shall be heard and 
determined by one neutral arbitrator and two party 
arbitrators, one jointly appointed by all Claimants and 
one jointly appointed by all Respondents. Parties who are 
entitled to select a party arbitrator may agree to waive 
this right. If all parties agree, these arbitrations will be 
heard by a single neutral arbitrator. 
Payment of arbitrators' fees and expenses 
Health Plan will pay the fees and expenses of the neutral 
arbitrator under certain conditions as set forth in the 
Rules of Procedure. In all other arbitrations, the fees and 
expenses of the neutral arbitrator shall be paid one-half 
by the Claimants and one-half by the Respondents. 
If the parties select party arbitrators, Claimants shall be 
responsible for paying the fees and expenses of their 
party arbitrator and Respondents shall be responsible for 
paying the fees and expenses of their party arbitrator. 
Costs 
Except for the aforementioned fees and expenses of the 
neutral arbitrator, and except as otherwise mandated by 
laws that apply to arbitrations under this "Binding 
Arbitration" section, each party shall bear the party's own 
attorneys' fees, witness fees, and other expenses incurred 
in prosecuting or defending against a claim regardless of 
the nature of the claim or outcome of the arbitration. 
General provisions 
A claim shall be waived and forever barred if (1) on the 
date the Demand for Arbitration of the claim is served, 
the claim, if asserted in a civil action, would be barred as 
to the Respondent served by the applicable statute of 
limitations, (2) Claimants fail to pursue the arbitration 
claim in accord with the Rules of Procedure with 
reasonable diligence, or (3) the arbitration hearing is not 
commenced within five years after the earlier of (a) the 
date the Demand for Arbitration was served in accord 
with the procedures prescribed herein, or (b) the date of 
filing of a civil action based upon the same incident, 
transaction, or related circumstances involved in the 
claim. A claim may be dismissed on other grounds by the 
neutral arbitrator based on a showing of a good cause. If 
a party fails to attend the arbitration hearing after being 
given due notice thereof, the neutral arbitrator may 
proceed to determine the controversy in the party's 
absence. 
The California Medical Injury Compensation Reform 
Act of 1975 (including any amendments thereto), 
including sections establishing the right to introduce 
evidence of any insurance or disability benefit payment 
to the patient, the limitation on recovery for non-
economic losses, and the right to have an award for 
future damages conformed to periodic payments, shall 
apply to any claims for professional negligence or any 
other claims as permitted or required by law. 
Arbitrations shall be governed by this "Binding 
Arbitration" section, Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration 
Act, and the California Code of Civil Procedure 
provisions relating to arbitration that are in effect at the 
time the statute is applied, together with the Rules of 
Procedure, to the extent not inconsistent with this 
"Binding Arbitration" section. In accord with the rule 
that applies under Sections 3 and 4 of the Federal 
Arbitration Act, the right to arbitration under this 
"Binding Arbitration" section shall not be denied, stayed, 
or otherwise impeded because a dispute between a 
Member Party and a Kaiser Permanente Party involves 
both arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims or because one 
or more parties to the arbitration is also a party to a 
pending court action with a third party that arises out of 
the same or related transactions and presents a possibility 
of conflicting rulings or findings. 
Termination of Membership 
Your membership termination date is the first day you 
are not covered (for example, if your termination date is 
January 1, 2022, your last minute of coverage was at 
11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2021). You will be billed as 
a non-Member for any Services you receive after your 
membership terminates, except for certain pediatric 
dental Services described in a Pediatric Dental Services 
Amendment to this EOC (if applicable). If your plan has 
a Pediatric Dental Services Amendment, it will be 
attached to this EOC, and it will be listed in the EOC's 
Table of Contents. When your membership terminates, 
Health Plan and Plan Providers have no further liability 
or responsibility under this EOC, except as provided 
under "Payments after Termination" in this "Termination 
of Membership" section.

If you are enrolled directly with Kaiser 
Permanente 
You may terminate your membership by sending written 
notice, signed by the Subscriber, to the address below. If 
you are a Subscriber with enrolled Dependents, we will 
terminate the entire Family unless you submit an account 
change form indicating a new Subscriber under the 
account. It is important that you submit your termination 
notice as soon as you know that you want to terminate 
your coverage. Your membership will terminate at 11:59 
p.m. on the day we receive your notice, or the date you 
indicate in your written notice to us, whichever is later. 
All amounts payable related to this EOC, including 
Premiums for the period prior to your termination date, 
continue to be due and payable in accord with the most 
recent invoice or notice you received.

If you have Ancillary Coverage 
If you have selected Ancillary Coverage provided under 
any other program, that plan's evidence of coverage 
cannot be terminated without terminating coverage under 
this EOC, unless the change is made during open 
enrollment or a special enrollment period. 
If you meet the eligibility requirements described under 
"Who Is Eligible" in the "Premiums, Eligibility, and 
Enrollment" section on the first day of a month, but later 
in that month you no longer meet those eligibility 
requirements, your membership will end at 11:59 p.m. on 
the last day of that month (unless a different date is 
identified under "Eligibility as a Dependent" in the 
"Premiums, Eligibility, and Enrollment" section). For 
example, if you become ineligible on December 5, 2021, 
your termination date is January 1, 2022, and your last 
minute of coverage is at 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 
2021. 
Continuation of membership 
If you lose eligibility as a Dependent and want to remain 
a Health Plan member, you might be able to enroll in one 
of our Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families 
plans as a subscriber. If you want your new individual 
plan coverage to be effective when your Dependent 
coverage ends, you must submit your application within 
the special enrollment period for enrolling in an 
individual plan due to loss of other coverage. Otherwise, 
you will have to wait until the next annual open 
enrollment period. 
To request an application to enroll directly with us, 
please go to kp.org or call our Member Service Contact 
Center. For information about plans that are available 
through Covered California, see "Covered California" 
below. 
Covered California 
U.S. citizens or legal residents of the U.S. can buy health 
care coverage from Covered California. This is 
California's health insurance marketplace ("the 
Exchange"). You may apply for help to pay for 
premiums and copayments but only if you buy coverage 
through Covered California. This financial assistance 
may be available if you meet certain income guidelines. 
To learn more about coverage that is available through 
Covered California, visit CoveredCA.com or call 
Covered California at 1-800-300-1506 (TTY users call 
711). 
Termination for Cause 
If you intentionally commit fraud in connection with 
membership, Health Plan, or a Plan Provider, we may 
terminate your membership by sending written notice to 
the Subscriber; termination will be effective 30 days 
from the date we send the notice. Some examples of 
fraud include: 
•  Misrepresenting eligibility information about you or a 
•  Presenting an invalid prescription or physician order 
•  Misusing a Kaiser Permanente ID card (or letting 
someone else use it) 
•  Giving us incorrect or incomplete material 
information. For example, you have entered into a 
Surrogacy Arrangement and you fail to send us the 
information we require under "Surrogacy 
arrangements" under "Reductions" in the "Exclusions, 
Limitations, Coordination of Benefits, and 
Reductions" section 
•  Failing to notify us of changes in family status or 
Medicare coverage that may affect your eligibility or 
benefits 
After your first 24 months of individuals and families 
coverage, we may not terminate you for cause solely 
because you gave us incorrect or incomplete material 
information in your application for health coverage. 
If we terminate your membership for cause, you will not 
be allowed to enroll in Health Plan in the future. We may 
also report criminal fraud and other illegal acts to the 
authorities for prosecution.

Termination for Nonpayment of 
Premiums 
If you do not pay your required Premiums by the due 
date, we may terminate your membership as described in 
this "Termination for Nonpayment of Premiums" section. 
If you intend to terminate your membership, be sure to 
notify us as described under "How You May Terminate 
Your Membership" in this "Termination of Membership" 
section, as you will be responsible for any Premiums 
billed to you unless you let us know before the first of 
the coverage month that you want us to terminate your 
coverage. 
Your Premium payment for the upcoming coverage 
month is due on the first day of that month. If we do not 
receive Full Premium payment on or before the first day 
of the coverage month, we will send a notice of 
nonreceipt of payment (a "Late Notice") to the 
Subscriber's address of record. This Late Notice will 
include the following information: 
•  A statement that we have not received Full Premium 
payment and that we will terminate this EOC for 
nonpayment if we do not receive the required 
Premiums within 30 days after the date of the Late 
Notice 
•  The amount of Premiums that are due 
•  The specific date and time when the memberships of 
the Subscriber and all Dependents will end if we do 
not receive the required Premiums 
If we terminate this EOC because we did not receive the 
required Premiums when due, your membership will end 
at 11:59 p.m. on the 30th day after the date of the Late 
Notice. Your coverage will continue during this 30-day 
grace period, but upon termination you will be 
responsible for paying all past due Premiums, including 
the Premiums for this grace period. 
We will mail a Termination Notice to the Subscriber's 
address of record if we do not receive Full Premium 
payment within 30 days after the date of the Late Notice. 
The Termination Notice will include the following 
information: 
•  A statement that we have terminated this EOC for 
nonpayment of Premiums 
•  The specific date and time when the memberships of 
the Subscriber and all Dependents ended 
•  Your appeal rights 
After termination of your membership for nonpayment of 
Premiums, you are still responsible for paying all 
amounts due. 
If we receive advance payment of the premium 
tax credit on your behalf 
If we receive advance payment of the premium tax credit 
on your behalf, then you are responsible for paying the 
portion of the monthly Premiums that equals the Full 
Premiums minus the advance payment of the premium 
tax credit that we receive on your behalf for that month. 
If we do not receive your portion of the monthly 
Premiums on time, we will provide a three-month grace 
period. 
We will send written notice stating when the grace 
period begins. The notice will explain when Premiums 
are due and when your coverage will terminate if you do 
not pay your portion of all outstanding Premiums. If we 
do not receive your portion of all outstanding Premiums 
(including any Premiums for the grace period) by the end 
of the grace period, we may terminate your membership. 
Termination for Discontinuance of a 
Product or all Products 
We may terminate your membership if we discontinue 
offering this product as permitted or required by law. If 
we continue to offer other individual (nongroup) 
products, we may terminate your membership under this 
product by sending you written notice at least 90 days 
before the termination date. You will be able to enroll in 
any other product we are then offering in the individual 
(nongroup) market if you meet all eligibility 
requirements. Under the Affordable Care Act, individual 
plan coverage is available without medical review. The 
premiums and coverage under the other individual plan 
may differ from those under this EOC. If we discontinue 
offering all individual (nongroup) products, we may 
terminate your membership by sending you written 
notice at least 180 days before the termination date. 
Payments after Termination 
If we terminate your membership for cause or for 
nonpayment, we will: 
•  Within 30 days, refund any amounts we owe for 
Premiums you paid after the termination date 
•  Pay you any amounts we have determined that we 
owe you for claims during your membership in 
accord with the "Emergency Services and Urgent 
Care" and "Dispute Resolution" sections 
We will deduct any amounts you owe Health Plan or 
Plan Providers from any payment we make to you.

Rescission of Membership 
Miscellaneous Provisions 
During your first 24 months of coverage, we may rescind 
your membership after it becomes effective (completely 
cancel your membership so that no membership ever 
existed) if we determine you or anyone seeking 
membership on your behalf did any of the following 
before your membership became effective: 
•  Performed an act, practice, or omission that 
constitutes fraud in connection with your enrollment 
or enrollment application 
•  Made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact 
in connection with your enrollment or enrollment 
application, such as intentionally omitting a material 
fact 
•  Intentionally failed to inform us of material changes 
to the information in your enrollment application 
We will send written notice to the Subscriber at least 30 
days before we rescind your membership, but the 
rescission will completely cancel your membership so 
that no membership ever existed. Our notice will explain 
the basis for our decision and how you can appeal this 
decision. If your coverage is rescinded, you must pay full 
Charges for any Services we covered. We will refund all 
applicable Premium except that we may subtract any 
amounts you owe us. You will be ineligible to re-apply 
for membership until the next open enrollment period. 
After your first 24 months of coverage, we may not 
rescind your membership if you or someone on your 
behalf gave us incorrect or incomplete material 
information, whether or not you or someone on your 
behalf willfully intended to give us that information. 
Appealing Membership Termination or 
Rescission 
If you believe that we have terminated or rescinded your 
membership improperly, you may file a grievance to 
appeal the decision. Please refer to the "Grievances" in 
the "Dispute Resolution" section for information on how 
to file a grievance. 
State Review of Membership 
Termination 
If you believe that we have terminated your membership 
because of your ill health or your need for care, you may 
request a review of the termination by the California 
Department of Managed Health Care (please see 
"Department of Managed Health Care Complaints" in the 
"Dispute Resolution" section). 
Administration of this EOC 
We may adopt reasonable policies, procedures, and 
interpretations to promote orderly and efficient 
administration of this EOC. 
Advance Directives 
The California Health Care Decision Law offers several 
ways for you to control the kind of health care you will 
receive if you become very ill or unconscious, including 
the following: 
•  A Power of Attorney for Health Care lets you name 
someone to make health care decisions for you when 
you cannot speak for yourself. It also lets you write 
down your own views on life support and other 
treatments 
•  Individual health care instructions let you express 
your wishes about receiving life support and other 
treatment. You can express these wishes to your 
doctor and have them documented in your medical 
chart, or you can put them in writing and have that 
included in your medical chart 
To learn more about advance directives, including how 
to obtain forms and instructions, contact the Member 
Services Department at a Plan Facility. For more 
information about advance directives, refer to our 
website at kp.org or call our Member Service Contact 
Center.

entitled to benefits under this EOC and we have the 
discretionary authority to review and evaluate claims that 
arise under this EOC. We conduct this evaluation 
independently by interpreting the provisions of this EOC. 
We may use medical experts to help us review claims. If 
coverage under this EOC is subject to the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") claims 
procedure regulation (29 CFR 2560.503-1), then we are a 
"named claims fiduciary" to review claims under this

governed in accord with California law and any 
provision that is required to be in this EOC by state or 
federal law shall bind Members and Health Plan whether 
or not set forth in this EOC. 
No Waiver 
Our failure to enforce any provision of this EOC will not 
constitute a waiver of that or any other provision, or 
impair our right thereafter to require your strict 
performance of any provision.

Our notices to you will be sent to the most recent address 
we have for the Subscriber, except that if the Subscriber 
has chosen to receive these membership agreement and

they should contact our Member Service Contact Center

Introduction 
This document amends your Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (Health Plan) EOC to add coverage for pediatric dental 
services as described in this Pediatric Dental Services Amendment ("Amendment"). All provisions of the EOC apply to 
coverage described in this document except for the following sections: 
•  "How to Obtain Services" (except that the completion of services information in the "Contracts with Plan Providers" 
section does apply to coverage described in this document) 
•  "Plan Facilities" 
•  "Emergency Services and Urgent Care" 
•  "Post-Service Claims and Appeals" 
•  "Dispute Resolution" 
•  "Benefits," except that the information under "Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum" in the "Benefits" section does apply 
These pediatric dental Benefits are for Eligible Pediatric Enrollees. 
The DeltaCare USA Program provides essential pediatric dental care benefits. Benefits are accessed through the DeltaCare 
USA Individual Network, a convenient network of Contract Dentists and established dental professionals, who are screened 
to ensure that standards of quality, access and safety are maintained.  
Health Plan contracts with Delta Dental to make the DeltaCare USA Program and its DeltaCare USA Individual Network 
available to you. You are assigned a Contract Dentist from the DeltaCare USA Individual Network. You can obtain covered 
Benefits from your assigned Contract Dentist without a referral from a Plan Physician. When you visit your assigned 
Contract Dentist your Cost Share is due, and you pay only the applicable Cost Share of Benefits up to the Plan Out-of-
Pocket Maximum. See the "Cost Share Summary" section of your EOC for information about your Plan Out-of-Pocket 
Maximum. 
Definitions 
In addition to the terms defined in the "Definitions" section of your Health Plan EOC the following terms, when capitalized 
and used in any part of this Amendment have the following meanings:

this Program.

Benefits to Enrollees under this Program.

Contract  Specialist  means  a  DeltaCare  USA  Dentist  who  provides  Specialist  Services  and  who  has  agreed  to  provide 
Benefits to Enrollees under this Program.

specialized health care service plan. 
Dentist means a duly licensed dentist legally entitled to practice dentistry at the time and in the state or jurisdiction in which 
services are performed. 
Department of Managed Health Care is a department of the California Health and Human Services Agency which has 
charge of regulating specialized health care service plans. Also referred to as the "Department" or "DMHC."

Eligible Pediatric Enrollee means a person eligible for dental Benefits under this Amendment. Eligible Pediatric Enrollees 
are children from birth through the end of the month in which the child turns 19 who meet the eligibility requirements in 
your Health Plan EOC. 
Emergency Dental Condition means dental symptoms and/or pain that are so severe that a reasonable person would believe 
that, without immediate attention by a Dentist, they could reasonably be expected to result in any of the following:  
•  placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy 
•  serious impairment to bodily functions 
•  serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part 
•  death 
Emergency Dental Service means a dental screening, examination and evaluation by a Dentist, or, to the extent permitted 
by applicable law, by other appropriate licensed persons under the supervision of a Dentist, to determine if an Emergency 
Dental Condition exists and, if it does, the care, treatment, and surgery, if within the scope of that person's license, necessary 
to relieve or eliminate the Emergency Dental Condition, within the capability of the facility. 
Optional means any alternative procedure presented by the Contract Dentist that satisfies the same dental need as a covered 
procedure but is chosen by the Enrollee and is subject to the limitations and exclusions described in the Schedules attached 
to this Amendment. 
Out-of-Network means treatment by a Dentist who has not signed an agreement with Delta Dental to provide Benefits to 
Enrollees under the terms of this Amendment. 
Pediatric Enrollee means an Eligible Pediatric Enrollee enrolled to receive Benefits; may also be referred to as "Enrollee." 
Procedure Code means the Current Dental Terminology® ("CDT") number assigned to a Single Procedure by the American 
Dental Association. 
Program means the set of pediatric dental Benefits provided under this Amendment to your EOC. 
Single Procedure means a dental procedure that is assigned a separate Procedure Code. 
Special Health Care Need means a physical or mental impairment, limitation or condition that substantially interferes with 
an Enrollee's ability to obtain Benefits. Examples of such a Special Health Care Need are: 1) the Enrollee's inability to obtain 
access to the assigned Contract Dentist facility because of a physical disability, and 2) the Enrollee's inability to comply with 
their Contract Dentist's instructions during examination or treatment because of physical disability or mental incapacity. 
Specialist  Service  means  services  performed  by  a  Dentist  who  specializes  in  the  practice  of  oral  surgery,  endodontics, 
periodontics, orthodontics (if Medically Necessary) or pediatric dentistry. Specialist Services must be authorized by Delta 
Dental. 
Treatment in Progress means any Single Procedure that has been started while the Pediatric Enrollee was eligible to receive 
Benefits, and for which multiple appointments are necessary to complete the procedure, whether or not the Enrollee continues 
to be eligible for Benefits under this Program. Examples include: teeth that have been prepared for crowns, root canals where 
a working length has been established, full or partial dentures for which an impression has been taken and orthodontics when 
bands have been placed and tooth movement has begun.  
Urgent Dental Services means Medically Necessary Services for a condition that requires prompt dental attention but is not 
an Emergency Dental Condition. 
How to Obtain Pediatric Dental Services 
Upon enrollment, the Enrollee will be assigned to a Contract Dentist facility. The Enrollee may request changes to their 
assigned Contract Dentist facility by contacting Delta Dental Customer Care at 800-589-4618. A list of Contract Dentists is 
available to all Enrollees at deltadentalins.com. Enrollees in the same family may collectively select no more than three 
Contract Dentist facilities. The change must be requested prior to the 15th of the month to become effective on the first day 
of the following month. 
Delta Dental will provide you written notice of assignment to another Contract Dentist facility near the Enrollee's home if: 
1) a requested facility is closed to further enrollment, 2) a chosen Contract Dentist withdraws from the DeltaCare USA

Individual Network, or 3) an assigned facility requests, for good cause, that the Enrollee be re-assigned to another Contract 
Dentist facility. 
All Treatment in Progress must be completed before you change to another Contract Dentist facility. EACH ENROLLEE 
MUST GO TO THEIR ASSIGNED CONTRACT DENTIST TO OBTAIN COVERED SERVICES. 
All covered services must be performed at the Enrollee's assigned Contract Dentist facility. With the exception of 
Emergency Dental Services, Urgent Dental Services, and authorized Specialist Services, this Program does not pay for 
services received by Out-of-Network Dentists. All authorized Specialist Service claims will be paid by Delta Dental, less 
any applicable Cost Share. Any other treatment is not covered under this Program. 
A Contract Dentist may provide services either personally, or through associated Dentists, or the other technicians or 
hygienists who may lawfully perform the services. If an Enrollee is assigned to a dental school clinic for Specialist 
Services, those services may be provided by a Dentist, a dental student, a clinician or a dental instructor. 
If your assigned Contract Dentist terminates participation in the DeltaCare USA Individual Network, that Contract Dentist 
will complete all Treatment in Progress. If, for any reason, the Contract Dentist is unable to complete treatment, Delta 
Dental will make reasonable and appropriate provisions for the completion of such treatment by another Contract Dentist. 
Delta Dental will give you reasonable advance written notice if you will be materially or adversely affected by the 
termination, breach of contract, or inability of a Contract Dentist to perform services. 
Benefits, Limitations and Exclusions 
This Program provides the Benefits described in Schedule A subject to the limitations and exclusions described in Schedule 
B. With the exception of Emergency Dental Services, Urgent Dental Services, and authorized Specialist Services, Benefits 
are only available in the state of California. The services are performed as deemed appropriate by your assigned Contract 
Dentist. 
Continuity of Care 
If you are a current Enrollee, you may have the right to obtain completion of care with your terminated Contract Dentist for 
specified dental conditions. If you are a new Enrollee, you may have the right to completion of care with your Out-of-Network 
Dentist for specified dental conditions. You must make a specific request for this completion of care Benefit. To make a 
request, contact Delta Dental's Customer Care at 800-589-4618. You may also contact us to request a copy of Delta Dental's 
Continuity of Care Policy. Delta Dental is not required to continue care with the Dentist if you are not eligible under this 
Program or if Delta Dental cannot reach agreement with the Out-of-Network Dentist or the terminated Contract Dentist on 
the terms regarding Enrollee care in accordance with California law. 
Emergency Dental Services 
Emergency Dental Services are used for palliative relief, controlling of dental pain, and/or stabilizing the Enrollee's 
condition. The Enrollee's assigned Contract Dentist facility maintains a 24-hour emergency dental services system, 7 days a 
week. If the Enrollee is experiencing an Emergency Dental Condition, they can call 911 (where available) or obtain 
Emergency Dental Services from any Dentist without a referral. 
After Emergency Dental Services are provided, further non-emergency treatment is usually needed. Non-emergency 
treatment must be obtained at the Enrollee's assigned Contract Dentist facility. 
The Enrollee is responsible for any Cost Share for Emergency Dental Services received. Non-covered procedures will be 
the Enrollee's financial responsibility and will not be paid by this Program.

Urgent Pediatric Dental Services 
Inside the Delta Dental Service Area 
An Urgent Dental Service requires prompt dental attention but is not an Emergency Dental Condition. If an Enrollee thinks 
that they may need Urgent Dental Services, the Enrollee can call their Contract Dentist. 
Outside the Delta Dental Service Area 
If an Enrollee needs Urgent Dental Services due to an unforeseen dental condition or injury, this Program covers Medically 
Necessary dental Services when prompt attention is required from an Out-of-Network Dentist, if all of the following are 
true: 
•  The Enrollee receives the Urgent Dental Services from an Out-of-Network Dentist while temporarily outside the Delta 
Dental Service Area 
•  A reasonable person would have believed that the Enrollee's health would seriously deteriorate if they delayed treatment 
until they returned to the Delta Dental Service Area 
Enrollees do not need prior Authorization from Delta Dental to receive Urgent Dental Services outside the Delta Dental 
Service Area. Any Urgent Dental Services an Enrollee receives from Out-of-Network Dentists outside the Delta Dental 
Service Area are covered by this Program if the Benefits would have been covered if the Enrollee had received them from 
Contract Dentists. 
We do not cover follow-up care from Out-of-Network Dentists after the Enrollee no longer needs Urgent Dental Services. 
To obtain follow-up care from a Contract Dentist, the Enrollee can call their assigned Contract Dentist. 
The Enrollee is responsible for any Cost Share for Urgent Dental Services received. 
Timely Access to Care 
Contract Dentists, Contract Orthodontists and Contract Specialists have agreed waiting times to Enrollees for appointments 
for care which will never be greater than the following timeframes: 
•  for emergency care, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week 
•  for any urgent care, 72 hours for appointments consistent with the Enrollee's individual needs 
•  for any non-urgent care, 36 business days 
•  for any preventive services, 40 business days 
During non-business hours, the Enrollee will have access to their Contract Dentist's answering machine, answering service, 
cell phone or pager for guidance on what to do and whom to contact if the Enrollee is calling due to an Emergency Dental 
Condition. 
If the Enrollee calls Delta Dental's Customer Care, a representative will answer the phone within 10 minutes during normal 
business hours. 
Should the Enrollee need interpretation services when scheduling an appointment with any of our Contract Dentists, 
Contract Orthodontists or Contract Specialists' facilities, the Enrollee may call the Delta Dental Customer Care at 800-589-
4618 for assistance. 
Specialist Services 
Specialist Services for oral surgery, endodontics, periodontics or pediatric dentistry must be: 1) referred by your assigned 
Contract Dentist, and 2) authorized by Delta Dental. You pay the specified Cost Share. (Refer to Schedule A, Description of 
Benefits and Cost Share for Pediatric Enrollees and Schedule B, Limitations and Exclusions of Benefits.) 
Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families 
2021 Kaiser Permanente – Platinum 90 HMO

If the services of a Contract Orthodontist are needed, please refer to Orthodontics in Schedule A, Description of Benefits 
and Cost Share for Pediatric Enrollees and Schedule B, Limitations and Exclusions of Benefits to determine which 
procedures are covered under this Program. 
If you require Specialist Services and a Contract Specialist or Contract Orthodontist is not within 35 miles of your home 
address to provide these services, your assigned Contract Dentist must receive Authorization from Delta Dental to refer you 
to an Out-of-Network specialist to provide these Specialist Services. Specialist Services performed by an Out-of-Network 
specialist that are not authorized by Delta Dental will not be covered. 
Claims for Reimbursement 
Claims for covered Emergency Dental Services or authorized Specialist Services should be sent to Delta Dental within 90 
days of the end of treatment. Valid claims received after the 90-day period will be reviewed if you can show that it was not 
reasonably possible to submit the claim within that time. All claims must be received within one (1) year of the treatment 
date. The address for claims submission is: Delta Dental, Claims Department, P.O. Box 1810, Alpharetta, GA 30023. 
Cost Share and Other Charges 
You are required to pay any Cost Share listed in Schedule A. Your Cost Share is paid directly to the Dentist who provides 
treatment. Charges for visits after normal visiting hours are listed in Schedule A. 
In the event that Delta Dental fails to pay a Contract Dentist, you will not be liable to that Dentist for any sums owed by 
Delta Dental. By statute, the DeltaCare USA dentist contract contains a provision prohibiting a Contract Dentist from 
charging an Enrollee for any sums owed by Delta Dental. Except for the provisions in the "Emergency Dental Services" 
section, if you have not received Authorization for treatment from an Out-of-Network Dentist and we fail to pay that Out-
of-Network Dentist, you may be liable to that Dentist for the cost of services. For further clarification, see the "Emergency 
Dental Services" and "Specialist Services" sections. 
Second Opinion 
You may request a second opinion if you disagree with or question the diagnosis and/or treatment plan determination made 
by your Contract Dentist. You may also be requested to obtain a second opinion to verify the necessity and appropriateness 
of dental treatment or the application of Benefits. 
Second opinions will be rendered by a licensed Dentist in a timely manner, appropriate to the nature of the Enrollee's 
condition. Requests involving an imminent and serious threat to the Enrollee’s health, including, but not limited to, the 
potential loss of life, limb, or other major bodily function, or a lack of timeliness that would be detrimental to the Enrollee’s 
ability to regain maximum function, will be expedited (Authorization approved or denied within 72 hours of receipt of the 
request, whenever possible). For assistance or additional information regarding the procedures and timeframes for second 
opinion Authorizations, contact the Delta Dental Customer Care at 800-589-4618 or write to Delta Dental at P.O. Box 
1810, Alpharetta, GA 30023. 
Second opinions will be provided at another Contract Dentist's facility, unless otherwise authorized by Delta Dental. A 
second opinion by an Out-of-Network Dentist will be authorized if an appropriately qualified Contract Dentist is not 
available. Only second opinions which have been approved or authorized by Delta Dental will be paid. You will be sent a 
written notification if your request for a second opinion is not authorized. If you disagree with this determination, you may 
file a grievance with Delta Dental. Refer to the "Enrollee Complaint Procedure" section for more information.

Special Health Care Needs 
If an Enrollee believes they have a Special Health Care Need, the Enrollee should contact Delta Dental's Customer Care at 
800-589-4618. Delta Dental will confirm that a Special Health Care Need exists and what arrangements can be made to 
assist the Enrollee in obtaining such Benefits. 
Delta Dental will not be responsible for the failure of any Contract Dentist to comply with any law or regulation concerning 
structural office requirements that apply to a Dentist treating persons with Special Health Care Needs. 
Many facilities provide Delta Dental with information about special features of their offices, including accessibility 
information for patients with mobility impairments. To obtain information regarding facility accessibility, contact Delta 
Dental's Customer Care at 800-589-4618. 
Facility Accessibility 
Dentist Compensation 
A Contract Dentist is compensated by Delta Dental through monthly capitation (an amount based on the number of 
Enrollees assigned to the Contract Dentist), and by Enrollees through required Cost Share for treatment received. A 
Contract Specialist is compensated by Delta Dental through an agreed-upon amount for each covered procedure, less the 
applicable Cost Share paid by the Enrollee. In no event does Delta Dental pay a Contract Dentist or a Contract Specialist 
any incentive as an inducement to deny, reduce, limit or delay any appropriate treatment. 
You may obtain further information concerning Dentist compensation by calling Delta Dental at 800-589-4618. 
Processing Policies 
The dental care guidelines for this Program explain to Contract Dentists what services are covered under this Amendment. 
Contract Dentists will use their professional judgment to determine which services are appropriate for the Enrollee. 
Services performed by the Contract Dentist that fall under the scope of Benefits of this Program are provided, subject to 
any Cost Share. If a Contract Dentist believes that an Enrollee should seek treatment from a specialist, the Contract Dentist 
contacts Delta Dental for a determination of whether the proposed treatment is a covered Benefit. Delta Dental will also 
determine whether the proposed treatment requires treatment by a Contract Specialist. An Enrollee may contact Delta 
Dental's Customer Care at 800-589-4618 for information about this Program's dental care guidelines. 
A Benefit appropriately provided through teledentistry is covered on the same basis and to the same extent that the Benefit is 
covered through in-person diagnosis, consultation, or treatment. 
Coordination of Benefits 
Coordination of benefits means the method by which we pay for dental Benefits when you are covered by another dental 
plan. The dental Benefits under this Amendment will be primary to any other dental coverage purchased by the Enrollee. 
This means the dental provider will send any dental claims to Delta Dental first for payment under the dental Benefits 
covered in this Amendment. 
Enrollee Complaint Procedure 
Complaints regarding dental services: 
Delta Dental or the Administrator shall provide notification if any dental services or claims are denied, in whole or in part, 
stating the specific reason or reasons for the denial. If you have a complaint regarding the denial of dental services or

performed by a Contract Dentist, you may call Delta Dental's Customer Care at 800-589-4618 or the complaint may be 
addressed in writing to: 
Delta Dental of California 
Quality Management Department 
P.O. Box 6050 
Artesia, CA 90702 
Written communication must include: 1) the Pediatric Enrollee's name, address, telephone number and ID number and 2) 
the Dentist's name and facility location. 
"Grievance" means a written or oral expression of dissatisfaction regarding Delta Dental and/or your dental provider, 
including quality of care concerns, and shall include a complaint, dispute, request for reconsideration or appeal made by 
Pediatric Enrollee or the Enrollee's representative. Where Delta Dental is unable to distinguish between a grievance and an 
inquiry, it shall be considered a grievance. 
"Complaint" is the same as "grievance." 
"Complainant" is the same as "grievant" and means the person who filed the grievance including the Enrollee, a 
representative designated by the Enrollee, or other individual with authority to act on behalf of the Enrollee. 
Within five calendar days of the receipt of any complaint, the quality management coordinator will forward to you a written 
acknowledgment of the complaint which will include the date of receipt and contact information. Certain complaints may 
require that you be referred to a Dentist for clinical evaluation of the dental services provided. We will forward to you a 
determination, in writing, within 30 calendar days of receipt of a complaint. If the complaint involves an Emergency Dental 
Condition, Delta Dental will provide the Enrollee written notification regarding the disposition or pending status of the 
grievance within three days. 
The Department is responsible for regulating health care service plans. If you have a grievance against Delta Dental, you 
should first telephone Delta Dental at 1-800-589-4618 and use Delta Dental's grievance process above before contacting the 
Department. Utilizing this grievance procedure does not prohibit any potential legal rights or remedies that may be 
available to you. If you need help with a grievance involving an Emergency Dental Condition, a grievance that has not been 
satisfactorily resolved by Delta Dental, or a grievance that has remained unresolved for more than 30 days, you may call the 
Department for assistance. 
Complaints involving an adverse benefit determination: 
For complaints involving an adverse benefit determination (e.g. a denial, modification or termination of a requested benefit 
or claim), the Enrollee must file a request for review (a complaint) with Delta Dental within 180 calendar days after receipt 
of the adverse determination. Our review will take into account all information, regardless of whether such information was 
submitted or considered initially. The review shall be conducted by a person who is neither the individual who made the 
original benefit determination, nor the subordinate of such individual. Upon request and free of charge, we will provide the 
Enrollee with copies of any pertinent documents that are relevant to the benefit determination, a copy of any internal rule, 
guideline, protocol, and/or explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment if relied upon in making the benefit 
determination. 
If the review of a denial is based, in whole or in part, on a lack of medical necessity, experimental treatment, or a clinical 
judgment in applying the terms of this Amendment, Delta Dental shall consult with a Dentist who has appropriate training 
and experience. If any consulting Dentist is involved in the review, the identity of such consulting Dentist will be available 
upon request. 
Within five calendar days of the receipt of any complaint, the quality management coordinator will forward to you a written 
acknowledgment of the complaint which will include the date of receipt and contact information. Certain complaints may

require that you be referred to a Dentist for clinical evaluation of the dental services provided. Delta Dental will forward to 
you a determination, in writing, within 30 calendar days of receipt of your complaint. 
Complaints regarding all other issues: 
If you have any other type of complaint or grievance, you can file a grievance with Health Plan. Your grievance must 
explain your issue, such as the reasons why you believe a decision was in error or why you are dissatisfied about Services 
you received. You may submit your grievance orally or in writing to Health Plan as described in the "Dispute Resolution" 
section of your EOC. If your complaint involves the termination of coverage, you may contact the Department 
immediately. 
Independent Medical Review ("IMR"): 
You may also be eligible for an IMR. If you are eligible for IMR, the IMR process will provide an impartial review of 
medical decisions made by Delta Dental related to the medical necessity of a proposed service or treatment, coverage 
decisions for treatments that are experimental or investigational in nature and payment disputes for emergency or urgent 
medical services. The Department also has a toll-free telephone number (1-888-466-2219) and a TDD line (1-877-688-
9891) for the hearing and speech impaired. The Department's Internet website (www.dmhc.ca.gov) has complaint forms, 
IMR application forms and instructions online.

Endnotes: 
Unless clarified elsewhere, base metal is the Benefit. If noble or high noble metal (precious) is used for an implant/abutment 
supported crown or fixed bridge retainer, the Enrollee will be charged the additional laboratory cost of the noble or high noble 
metal. If covered, an additional laboratory charge also applies to a titanium crown. 
If services for a listed procedure are performed by the assigned Contract Dentist, the Enrollee pays the specified Cost Share. 
Listed procedures which require a Dentist to provide Specialist Services, and are referred by the assigned Contract Dentist, 
must be authorized by Delta Dental. The Enrollee pays the Cost Share specified for such services. 
Optional or upgraded procedure(s) are defined as any alternative procedure(s) presented by the Contract Dentist and formally 
agreed upon by financial consent that satisfies the same dental need as a covered procedure. Enrollee may elect an Optional 
or upgraded procedure, subject to the limitations and exclusions of this Amendment. The applicable charge to the Enrollee is 
the difference between the Contract Dentist's regularly charged fee (or contracted fee, when applicable) for the Optional or 
upgraded procedure and the covered procedure, plus any applicable Cost Share for the covered procedure. 
Administration of these plan designs must comply with requirements of the pediatric dental EHB benchmark plan, including
